# About this Workshop

## Introduction to Oracle Database@Google Cloud
Oracle Database@Google Cloud is an Oracle Cloud Database service that runs Oracle Database workloads in your Google Cloud environment. Built on Oracle's best database services - Oracle Exadata Database Service and Oracle Autonomous Database - you can quickly develop and modernize applications with capabilities such as Oracle Database 23ai AI Vector Search and Google’s Vertex AI. 

With native integration, you can deploy your Oracle database services in a Google Cloud data center running on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) Exadata hardware with minimal latency. Workloads reside in Google Cloud and the Exadata systems used by both services are deployed in Google Cloud data centers. You get the best from Oracle and Google Cloud – which includes the performance and monitoring tools, developer tools, analytics, etc.

In this workshop, you will learn how to deploy Autonomous Database@Google Cloud. Then, you will run database workloads, monitor those workloads and migrate data to the platform.

Estimated Workshop Time: 90 minutes

## Workshop Objectives
This set of hands-on-labs is designed to assist developers, multicloud architects, and database users in setting up and using various features of the **Autonomous Database Service**. The labs in this workshop address provisioning Autonomous Database@Google Cloud, application development and migrating data to Autonomous Database@Google Cloud.

## Prerequisites
- An existing Google Cloud Account

If you do not have an Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) account, you can create one during your service deployment. If you do have an OCI account, you can use it with Oracle Database@Google Cloud.
