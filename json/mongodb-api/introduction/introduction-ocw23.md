# Introduction

## About this Workshop

MongoDB is a popular, single-purpose database used for storing JSON documents.

In this workshop, we'll show you how you can replace your MongoDB database with a powerful, multi-model Oracle Database but still run standard MongoDB tools and programs against that database, with little or no coding changes required.

Once you're using Oracle Database to store your document collections, you have access to that very same data from all the advanced tools provided by Oracle, such as machine learning, graph analytics and many others. Your data can remain in document collections, but be accessed from the SQL language as well as using MongoDB commands. You can join JSON and relational data, without any need to export the JSON data to relational format first.

In the workshop, you will use Oracle Database 23ai Free and a local ORDS installation to connect to the database using MongoDB tools. You'll learn how you can work with JSON data using both standard MongoDB tools, and using Oracle Database tools.

This lab is organized into different topics, each topic consists of multiple steps. Some steps are a bit more advanced, they're marked as 'advanced' and you can skip them. After completing this workshop a user has a very good understanding of what JSON features are available in Oracle Database and when to use them. A user will also have learned why Oracle database is better suited for JSON Development than MongoDB, etc.

Estimated Workshop Time: 1.5 hours

### Workshop Scenario

In this workshop, we'll implement a very simple employee database. 

We'll use Oracle Database 23ai Free and connect to it using the standard "MongoDB Shell" tool. We'll use that to create an employee collection, and populate it with some employee records.

We'll then explore the same data using "Database Actions" powered by our local ORDS installation.

You can complete this entire workshop using your web browser and a command or shell window. As part of the lab we will install MongoDB Shell, a command-line tool for accessing MongoDB and MongoDB-compatible databases.

This workshop consists of multiple 'labs' - each describing one aspect or feature. This lab has been designed for 19c AJD database but should also work on 21c AJD database and these concepts are also applicable to on-premise versions.

### About JSON

Before we get started let's take a brief look at JSON (you may skip this step if you're already familiar with it)

##### What is JSON?

JSON is a human-readable, self-describing format to represent data in a hierarchical format. This is best illustrated by an example - a JSON object with information about a person:

```
<copy>
{
	"id":100,
	"firstName":"John",
	"lastName":"Smith",
	"age":25,
	"address":{
		"street":"21 2nd Streetâ€œ,"city":"New York",
		"state":"NY","postalCode":"10021",	 
		"isBusiness":false	
	},	
	"phoneNumbers":[		
		{"type":"home","number":"212 555-1234"},	
		{"type":"mobile","number":"646 555-4567"}
	],
	"bankruptcies":null,
	"lastUpdated":"2019-05-13T13:03:35+0000"
}
</copy>
```

Objects consist of key-value pairs: the key "id" has the value 100. Keys are always strings (identified by double quotes). Scalar values can be numeric (like 100), strings ("John"), Boolean (true, false) or null. The ordering of key-value pairs in an object is not relevant but keys have to be unique per object. Keys can also point to a non-scalar value, namely another object (like address) or array (phoneNumbers). A JSON array is an ordered list of values. You can think of objects and arrays both being containers with values; in an object, the key identifies the value whereas in an array it is the position that identifies the value.

No problem, if this does not make much sense yet, you'll get more comfortable with JSON very soon - it is really easy!

One thing to keep in mind is that JSON needs no upfront definition of keys or data types. You can easily modify the shape (schema) of your data.

#### Why is JSON so popular for application development?

Schema-flexibility is a big reason why JSON makes a lot of sense for application development. Especially in the initial phase, an application is quite dynamic, new fields are needed, interfaces get changed, etc. Maintaining a relational schema is hard if application changes often need a change in the underlying tables and existing data needs to be modified to fit into the new schema. JSON makes this much easier as new documents may look different than the old ones (for example have additional fields).

JSON also avoids normalization of a business object into multiple tables. Look at the example above with a customer having multiple phone numbers. How would we store the phone numbers relationally? In separate columns (thus limiting the total amount of phone numbers per person) or in a separate table so that we need to join multiple tables if we want to retrieve on business object? In reality most business objects get normalized into many more than two tables so an application developer has to deal with the complexities of inserting into many tables when adding a new object and joining the tables back on queries - the SQL to do that can get quite complex. JSON on the other hand allows one to map an entire business object into one JSON document. Every insert or query now only affects one value in the database - no joins are needed.

Now you know what JSON is and also why so many people love it. Enough theory for now - time to code!

### Objectives

In this workshop, you will explore:
