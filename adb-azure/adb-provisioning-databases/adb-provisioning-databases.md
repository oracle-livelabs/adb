### Objectives

As a database user, DBA or application developer:

1. Rapidly deploy an Autonomous Transaction Processing databases.

### Required Artifacts

- An Azure account with a pre-configured Resource Group and a Virtual Network.

## Task 1: Create Autonomous Database@Azure

In this section, you will be provisioning an Autonomous database using the Azure portal.

1.	Login to Azure Portal (portal.azure.com) and navigate to All services. Then click on Oracle Database@Azure.

    NOTE: Please click skip if you are asked to enable multi-factor authorization.

For this lab, we will be using the following Subscription: **omcpmhol1**, Resource Group: **ocw24-hol-resource-group-east-us**, and Region: **East US**.

-  Enter the details in the **Configuration** page.

    *NOTE: Autonomous Database supports different workload types, including: Data Warehouse and Transaction Processing. Both of these workload types provide performance improvements and additional features that support operations for the specified workload.

- Enter the **Networking** configurations.

- Select the following under **Network access**
    
    *Note: TLS connections allow you to connect to your Autonomous Database without a wallet, if you use a JDBC thin driver with JDK8 or above. TLS connections require you to use an access control list (ACL) or private endpoint.*

- For the lab, we select the following and click Next. 

    ```
    Access type: Managed private virtual network IP only
    
    Required mutual TLS (mTLS) authentication: Disabled
