# About this Workshop

## Introduction to Oracle Autonomous Database@Azure
The ADB@Azure hands-on lab provides users with step-by-step instructions on provisioning Autonomous Database@Azure and instructions on how to connect Visual Studio with Autonomous Database, Migrate to Autonomous Database@Azure, Connect PowerBI with Autonomous Database, and chat with your data residing in Autonomous Database using Generative AI. 


Estimated Workshop Time: 90 minutes

## Workshop Objectives
This set of hands-on labs is designed to assist developers, multi-cloud architects, and database users in setting up and using various features of the **Autonomous Database@Azure Service**. The labs in this workshop address provisioning, application development, migrating, monitoring, and visualizing data using PowerBI and using Generative AI with Autonomous Database.

## Prerequisites
Pre-requisites required to begin on-boarding ADB@Azure:
- An existing Azure subscription
- An Azure VNet with a subnet delegated to the ADB@Azure service

If you do not have an Oracle Cloud (OCI) account, you can create one during your service deployment. If you do have an OCI account, you can use it with ADB@Azure.
