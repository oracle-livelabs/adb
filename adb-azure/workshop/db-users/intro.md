# About this Workshop

## Introduction to Oracle Autonomous Database@Azure
The ADB@Azure hands-on lab provides users with step-by-step instructions to provision Autonomous Database@Azure, connect Visual Studio with Autonomous Database, migrate to Autonomous Database@Azure, connect PowerBI with Autonomous Database, and chat with your data residing in Autonomous Database using Generative AI. 


Estimated Workshop Time: 90 minutes

## Workshop Objectives
This set of hands-on-labs is designed to assist developers, multicloud architects, and database users in setting up and using various features of the **Autonomous Database@Azure Service**. The labs in this workshop address provisioning, application development, migrating, monitoring, and visualizing data using PowerBI and using Generative AI with Autonomous Database.

## Prerequisites
- An existing Azure subscription
- An Azure VNet with a subnet delegated to Oracle.Database/networkAttachement

If you do not have an Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) account, you can create one during your service deployment. If you do have an OCI account, you can use it with Oracle Database@Azure.
