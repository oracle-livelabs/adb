# Data Safe with Autonomous Dedicated
## Introduction
Data Safe is a unified security control center for your Oracle Autonomous Databases in OCI. Data Safe provides security automation to easily detect PII and other sensitive data elements in your autonomous databases, create masked clones for test/dev, assess and monitor user security, centralize audit data and generate security and compliance reports. Data Safe also works on your on-premises Oracle databases and other OCI database services.

This workshop walks you through the steps to get started using Oracle Data Safe with ADB Dedicated on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure.
