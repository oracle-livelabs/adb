# Oracle Standard Tags

## Introduction
Oracle Cloud Infrastructure tagging allows you to add metadata to resources, defining keys and values and associating them with resources. You can use the tags to organize and list resources based on your business needs.

To enable customers to manage OCI resources securely and cost-effectively, Oracle provides a set of pre-defined tags in line with best practices for tagging resources. These tags are grouped into two namespaces - The **OracleStandard** namespace and the **OracleApplicationName** namespace.

This lab walks you through the steps to import Oracle Standard Tags into your tenancy, create and edit tag key definitions, and use the standard tags with your Autonomous Database.

Estimated Time: 20 minutes

### Objectives

As OCI Governance administrator and as database users:
1. Enforce tagging best practices.
2. Apply Tags seamlessly to OCI resources.


### Required Artifacts

- An Oracle Cloud Infrastructure account.
- Permission for users to use Tags. Refer to [this documentation](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Tagging/Tasks/managingtagsandtagnamespaces.htm#Who) to allow users to work with Tags.
- Have access to **Root Compartment** to import Oracle Standard Tags to the tenancy.


## Task 1: Import Oracle Standard Tags to your Tenancy

- Log in to OCI console and navigate to **Governance & Administration** and click **Tag Namespaces**.

**NOTE**: Import Standard Tags is only available from **root compartment**.

- Select the **root compartment** from **Compartment** dropdown, and click **Import Standard Tags**.

    ![This image shows the result of performing the above step.](./images/tag3.png " ")

- The **Import Standard Tags** page provides a set of Tag Keys for consistent governance across your tenancy. Tag namespace will be created at the root compartment.

    **NOTE**: The list of namespaces are continuously updated by OCI service teams. All new and modified Tags will be listed in the Import Standard Tags page.

    Here you see the Tag Key Definition for **Oracle-Standard** namespace; similarly you can click **OracleApplicationName** namespace to view Tag Key Definitions.

- Select **Oracle-Standard** Tag Namespace and click **Import**.

    ![This image shows the result of performing the above step.](./images/tag5.png " ")

- On successful import, you should see **Oracle-Standard** Tag Namespace listed under the **root** compartment.

## Task 2: Create or Edit Tag Key Definition

OCI Governance Administrators can add additional **Values** to an existing Tag Key Definition or create a new Tag Key Definition.

- Click **Governance & Administration** and navigate to **Tag Namespaces**.

    ![This image shows the result of performing the above step.](./images/tag2.png " ")

- Click the **Oracle-Standard** Tag Namespace that you created in **Task 1**.

    ![This image shows the result of performing the above step.](./images/tag6.png " ")

- The **Oracle-Standard** Tag Namespace **Details** page lists all the existing **Tag Key Definitions**.

    ![This image shows the result of performing the above step.](./images/tag8.png " ")

- Click **Create Tag Key Definition** to create a new Tag Key definition in the selected Tag Namespace.

    ![This image shows the result of performing the above step.](./images/tag9.png " ")

- Enter Tag Key, Description and Values and click **Create Tag Key Definition**.

    ![This image shows the result of performing the above step.](./images/tag10.png " ")

- You have successfully created a new **Tag Key Definition** for **Oracle-Standard** Namespace!

- To add or remove values from an existing **Tag Key Definition**, select your **Tag Key Definition**.

    ![This image shows the result of performing the above step.](./images/tag11.png " ")

- Click **Edit Tag Key Definition**.

    ![This image shows the result of performing the above step.](./images/tag12.png " ")

- Add or remove **Tag Values** and click **Save Changes**.

    ![This image shows the result of performing the above step.](./images/tag13.png " ")


## Task 3: Use Standard Tags with Autonomous Database

Tags can be added either at the time of creation of a resource, or by navigating to an existing resource and adding it.

- Click the menu and navigate to **Autonomous Database**. Choose an Autonomous Database type, such as **Autonomous Transaction Processing**.

    ![This image shows the result of performing the above step.](./images/tag14.png " ")

- Click **Create Autonomous Database**, and enter all the required fields.

You can learn how to create Autonomous Database in the **Provisioning an Autonomous Transaction Processing Database Instance** lab in the **Oracle Autonomous Database Dedicated for Developers and Database Users** LiveLabs workshop.

- Scroll down to the bottom of the **Create Autonomous Database** page, and click **Show Advanced Options**.

    ![This image shows the result of performing the above step.](./images/tag15.png " ")

- Select **Tags** and select **Oracle-Standard** under **Tag Namespace**. Select the appropriate **Tag Key** and click **Create Autonomous Database**.

    ![This image shows the result of performing the above step.](./images/tag16.png " ")

- You can also add Tags to an existing Autonomous Database. Select the Autonomous Database in which you would like to add the Tags, and click **Tags** in the **Autonomous Database Details** page.

    ![This image shows the result of performing the above step.](./images/tag17.png " ")

- Click **Add tags** and select **Oracle-Standard** under **Tag Namespace** and select the appropriate **Tag Key** and **Tag Value**. Click **Apply**.

    ![This image shows the result of performing the above step.](./images/tag18.png " ")
