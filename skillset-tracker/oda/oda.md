# Integration with Oracle Digital Assistant and Slack

## Introduction

In this lab you are going to go through a series of steps for provisioning an **Oracle Digital Assistant Instance**, download, import and test a Skill, create a **Slack Channel** and Workspace and integrate your Bot with Slack channel. **BotML** was used to create the Skill that you will download for this Demo.

The **Oracle Digital Assistant** makes API calls to the **Skillset Tracking Application** that contains data like names of managers,
their team members names, development areas, skills for each development area and skill value for each skill. All the data exists in a JSON format and the JSON is parsed to retrieve data from it.

In Slack Workspace, the Data will appear like buttons that you can select and what you have selected it will be sent to **Oracle Digital Assistant** as a variable, that will trigger another buttons as effect of the states in Flows that exists in the Digital Assistant. At some states you can choose the button or you can type as input/response the name of the manager/name of the employee/name of the skill/what is written on the button.

### Terminology
**Digital assistants** are virtual devices that help users accomplish tasks through natural language conversations, without having to seek out and wade through various apps and web sites. Each digital assistant contains a collection of specialized skills. When a user engages with the digital assistant, the digital assistant evaluates the user input and routes the conversation to and from the appropriate skills.

### Basic Concepts
  * **Intents** - Categories of actions or tasks users expect your skill to perform for them.
  * **Entities** - Variables that identify key pieces of information from user input that enable the skill to fulfill a task.
    Both intents and entities are common NLP (Natural Language Processing) concepts.
    NLP is the science of extracting the intention of text and relevant information from text.
  * **Components** - Provide your skill with various functions so that it can respond to users. These can be generic functions like outputting text, or they can return information from a backend and perform custom logic.
  * **Flows** - The definition for the skill-user interaction. The dialog flow describes how your skill responds and behaves according to user input.
  * **Channels** - Digital assistants and skills arenâ€™t apps that you download from an app marketplace, like iTunes. Instead, users access them through messaging platforms or through client messaging apps. Channels, which are platform-specific configurations, allow this access. A single digital assistant or skill can have several channels configured for it so that it can run on different services simultaneously. Example of Channels: Slack, Facebook Messenger
  Here is what happens when you use Slack as a channel for your digital assistant:
      * Slack hosts your digital assistant through the intermediary of a Slack app.
      * Users chat with your digital assistant through the Slack app in the Slack user interface.

Estimated Lab Time: 2 hours

### Objectives
In this lab, you will:
  * Create an Oracle Digital Assistant Service Instance
  * Access the Service Instance from the Infrastructure Console
  * Import developed Skill in your Oracle Digital Assistant Service Instance
  * Test the Skill with Conversation Tester
  * Integrate your Digital Assistant with Slack
  * Test the Digital Assistant in Slack

### Prerequisites
