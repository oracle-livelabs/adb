## Workshop 1: Find Circular Payment Chains using Graph Queries in Autonomous Database

Use graph analytics and visualization to detect potentially fraudulent money transfers.
This workshop covers how to load data in CSV files into the database and introduces key graph data modeling and analysis concepts and the interactive Graph Studio for working with graphs in an Autonomous Database. It shows you how to use graph queries to find circular payments, i.e. potentially fraudulent transactions. You will load data from CSV files containing Account and Transaction information. Then create a graph and finally query it and visualize the results.

## Workshop 2: Working with RDF Graphs in Graph Studio

Graph Studio in Oracle Autonomous Database enables users to model, create, query, and analyze property graph data. It includes notebooks, developer APIs for executing graph queries using PGQL, nearly 60 built-in graph algorithms, and offers dozens of visualizations including native graph visualization.
In addition to property graph, Graph Studio now extends support for semantic technologies, including storage, inference, and query capabilities for data and ontologies based on Resource Description Framework (RDF) and Web Ontology Language (OWL).   
Hence, you can now use Graph Studio for the following supported RDF features:

* Create an RDF graph
* Execute SPARQL queries on the RDF graph in a notebook paragraph
* Analyze and visualize RDF graphs

## Workshop 3: Work with Spatial Data in Oracle Database

This workshop introduces the spatial features of Oracle Database. You'll learn how to use spatial queries to identify items based on proximity and containment within a region.
