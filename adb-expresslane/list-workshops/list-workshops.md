## Autonomous Database 2: Self-service Tools for Everyone Using Oracle Autonomous Database

In this workshop you'll work on Oracle MovieStream, a fictitious on-line movie streaming company. In this scenario, customers log into Oracle MovieStream using their computers, tablets and phones where they are presented with a targeted list of movies based on their past viewing behavior. The company is now looking for better, smarter ways to track performance, identifying target customers with campaigns to promote new services, new movies and new viewing platforms.

Many of the scenarios in this workshop will very likely match the challenges you are seeing in your business and we hope the following examples will give you some insight into how Oracle can help you solve these common everyday challenges.

## Autonomous Database 4: Load and Analyze Your Data with Autonomous Database

In this workshop, you will go through the steps to get started using the Oracle Autonomous Database Serverless (ADB-S). You will provision a new ADB instance, load data from the object store and troubleshoot data loads, query external data residing on the object store, and visualize your data using Oracle Analytics Desktop.

## Machine learning 1: Machine Learning on Autonomous Database

Oracle integrates machine learning across the Oracle stack and the enterprise, fully leveraging Oracle Database and Oracle Autonomous Database. In this workshop, create a machine learning model and move the model to ADB. Explore machine learning notebooks and use prediction in applications.

## Machine learning 3: Introduction to Oracle Machine Learning for Python on Autonomous Database

In this hands-on lab, experience Oracle Machine Learning for Python on Oracle Autonomous Database. OML4Py supports scalable in-database data exploration and preparation using native Python syntax, invocation of in-database algorithms for model building and scoring, and embedded execution of user-defined Python functions from Python or REST APIs. OML4Py also includes the AutoML interface for automated algorithms and feature selection, and hyperparameter tuning. Join us for this tour of OML4Py.

## APEX 1: Building an App from a Spreadsheet using Oracle APEX

In this workshop, you create a fully featured, responsive Web app using Oracle APEX on Oracle Cloud. This workshop gets you a well-rounded understanding of low code app development with APEX. You will be amazed at how you went from a spreadsheet to a beautiful, and fully functional Web app to explore NYC High Schools in minutes!

This workshop walks you through uploading the NYC High Schools spreadsheet data into an Oracle database table, and then creating an application based on this new table. You will then play with the Faceted Search, Interactive Report, and improve the attached form. You will learn how to add a map region to the search page in order to visually enhance the page. You will also learn to download and use the application as a Progressive Web App (PWA).

## APEX 2: Build a Starter Online Shopping App using Oracle APEX!

This workshop walks you through the creation of a Shopping Cart application that allows administrators users to manage the products, customers, and stores.
On the other side, customers can review and add products to the Shopping Cart and eventually proceed to checkout.

## APEX 3: Building a Movies Watchlist Application using Oracle APEX

In this workshop, you will create an application where users can search for movies and add them to their personal watchlist. You will build out the application through each lab and cover many different APEX features to get a well-rounded understanding of app development with APEX.

You will use The Movie Database (TMDB) API to create REST data sources for finding movies and getting movie details. Using the data from TMDB, you will implement functionality to search for movies and view movie details. Once the movie search and details pages are built out, you will get an introduction to SQL Workshop in APEX, where you will use Quick SQL to create local tables to store user and movie data for their application.

The final part of the lab is developing the Watchlist page, where you will work with the Cards and Faceted Search regions to build out a page where a user can view, sort, and filter through their movie watchlist to find movies and either remove them or mark them as watched.

## Graph 1: Find Circular Payment Chains using Graph Queries in Autonomous Database

Use graph analytics and visualization to detect potentially fraudulent money transfers.
This workshop covers how to load data in CSV files into the database and introduces key graph data modeling and analysis concepts and the interactive Graph Studio for working with graphs in an Autonomous Database. It shows you how to use graph queries to find circular payments, i.e. potentially fraudulent transactions. You will load data from CSV files containing Account and Transaction information. Then create a graph and finally query it and visualize the results.

## Graph 2: Working with RDF Graphs in Graph Studio

Graph Studio in Oracle Autonomous Database enables users to model, create, query, and analyze property graph data. It includes notebooks, developer APIs for executing graph queries using PGQL, nearly 60 built-in graph algorithms, and offers dozens of visualizations including native graph visualization.
In addition to property graph, Graph Studio now extends support for semantic technologies, including storage, inference, and query capabilities for data and ontologies based on Resource Description Framework (RDF) and Web Ontology Language (OWL).   
Hence, you can now use Graph Studio for the following supported RDF features:

* Create an RDF graph
* Execute SPARQL queries on the RDF graph in a notebook paragraph
* Analyze and visualize RDF graphs
