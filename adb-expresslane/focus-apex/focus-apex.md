## Workshop 1: Building an App from a Spreadsheet using Oracle APEX

In this workshop, you create a fully featured, responsive Web app using Oracle APEX on Oracle Cloud. This workshop gets you a well-rounded understanding of low code app development with APEX. You will be amazed at how you went from a spreadsheet to a beautiful, and fully functional Web app to explore NYC High Schools in minutes!

This workshop walks you through uploading the NYC High Schools spreadsheet data into an Oracle database table, and then creating an application based on this new table. You will then play with the Faceted Search, Interactive Report, and improve the attached form. You will learn how to add a map region to the search page in order to visually enhance the page. You will also learn to download and use the application as a Progressive Web App (PWA).

## Workshop 2: Build a Starter Online Shopping App using Oracle APEX!

This workshop walks you through the creation of a Shopping Cart application that allows administrators users to manage the products, customers, and stores.
On the other side, customers can review and add products to the Shopping Cart and eventually proceed to checkout.

## Workshop 3: Building a Movies Watchlist Application using Oracle APEX

In this workshop, you will create an application where users can search for movies and add them to their personal watchlist. You will build out the application through each lab and cover many different APEX features to get a well-rounded understanding of app development with APEX.

You will use The Movie Database (TMDB) API to create REST data sources for finding movies and getting movie details. Using the data from TMDB, you will implement functionality to search for movies and view movie details. Once the movie search and details pages are built out, you will get an introduction to SQL Workshop in APEX, where you will use Quick SQL to create local tables to store user and movie data for their application.

The final part of the lab is developing the Watchlist page, where you will work with the Cards and Faceted Search regions to build out a page where a user can view, sort, and filter through their movie watchlist to find movies and either remove them or mark them as watched.
