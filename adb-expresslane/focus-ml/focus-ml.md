## Workshop 3: Introduction to Oracle Machine Learning for Python on Autonomous Database

In this hands-on lab, experience Oracle Machine Learning for Python on Oracle Autonomous Database. OML4Py supports scalable in-database data exploration and preparation using native Python syntax, invocation of in-database algorithms for model building and scoring, and embedded execution of user-defined Python functions from Python or REST APIs. OML4Py also includes the AutoML interface for automated algorithms and feature selection, and hyperparameter tuning. Join us for this tour of OML4Py.
