## Workshop 1: Autonomous Database 15 Minute Quick Start

In just 15 minutes, deploy an Autonomous Database optimized for data warehousing workloads, integrate that warehouse with a data lake, and then gain meaningful business insights.

## Workshop 2: Self-service Tools for Everyone Using Oracle Autonomous Database

In this workshop you'll work on Oracle MovieStream, a fictitious on-line movie streaming company. In this scenario, customers log into Oracle MovieStream using their computers, tablets and phones where they are presented with a targeted list of movies based on their past viewing behavior. The company is now looking for better, smarter ways to track performance, identifying target customers with campaigns to promote new services, new movies and new viewing platforms.

Many of the scenarios in this workshop will very likely match the challenges you are seeing in your business and we hope the following examples will give you some insight into how Oracle can help you solve these common everyday challenges.

## Workshop 3: Developing with JSON and SODA in Oracle Database

In this workshop, you will create a simple webshop using JSON and SODA with the Autonomous JSON Database. After completing this workshop you will have a very good understanding of what JSON features are available in Oracle Database and when to use them.

## Workshop 4: Load and Analyze Your Data with Autonomous Database

In this workshop, you will go through the steps to get started using the Oracle Autonomous Database Serverless (ADB-S). You will provision a new ADB instance, load data from the object store and troubleshoot data loads, query external data residing on the object store, and visualize your data using Oracle Analytics Desktop.

## Workshop 5: Load and update Moviestream data in Oracle ADW using Data Tools

This workshop is part of a series of workshops based around a movie streaming company called Oracle MovieStream In this workshop, you will go through the steps to load movie sales data into an Oracle Autonomous Data Warehouse Serverless (ADB-S). You will load data from the object store, enable data integrity checks and finally apply updates to the sales data.

## Workshop 6: Manage and Monitor Autonomous Database

Provision Autonomous Database and perform basic tasks like connecting, querying and loading data, and creating data visualizations. Extend your knowledge: use wallets for secure connections, monitor and manage ADB, scale for performance, apply auto scaling, enable disaster recovery, create refreshable clones, set event and alarm notification.

## Workshop 7: Integrate, Analyze and Act on All Data using Autonomous Database

This workshop uses Oracle Cloud's modern data platform for analytics to enable MovieStream to better understand their customers, predict churn and provide targeted recommendations and promotions. We'll start with two key components of MovieSteam's architecture. MovieStream is storing its data across Oracle Object Storage and Autonomous Database. Data is captured from various sources into a landing zone in object storage. This data is then processed (cleansed, transformed, and optimized) and stored in a gold zone on object storage. Once the data is curated, it is loaded into an Autonomous Database where it is analyzed by many (and varied) members of the user community - from data analysts to data scientists. These users will take advantage of a variety of Autonomous Database capabilities: advanced Oracle SQL to glean customer insights, Oracle Machine Learning to predict churn, and Oracle Spatial and Graph to provide targeted promotions.

## Workshop 8: Integrate, Analyze and Act on All Data using Autonomous Database

In this lab you will use Database Vault to implement advanced data access controls for Oracle Autonomous Database - including separation of duties, privileged user access controls, and enforcing a trusted path to data. Database Vault is one of the most important security controls you can apply to block the most common database attacks, including compromised user credentials and privilege escalation. Database Vault is included with Autonomous Database, including with Autonomous Database Cloud@Customer.

This lab is included in the DB Security Advanced lab. If you have completed that lab, then there is no need to do this one.
