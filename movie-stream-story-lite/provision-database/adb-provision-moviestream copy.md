In just a few minutes, Autonomous Database lets you deploy a complete data warehousing platform that can scale to your requirements. And, you can use its Database Tools to easily populate that warehouse from the data lake.

This lab walks you through the steps to get started using the Oracle Autonomous Database (Autonomous Data Warehouse [ADW] and Autonomous Transaction Processing [ATP]) on Oracle Cloud Interface. In this lab, you provision a new ADW instance.

Estimated Time: 5 minutes

### Objectives

In this lab, you will:

-   Create an Oracle Cloud Infrastructure compartment
-   Provision a new Autonomous Database

### Prerequisites

-   This lab requires completion of the Get Started section in the Contents menu on the left.

<if type="freetier">
## Task 1: Create a compartment

A compartment is a collection of cloud assets, like compute instances, load balancers, databases, and so on. By default, a root compartment was created for you when you created your tenancy (that is, when you registered for the trial account). It is possible to create everything in the root compartment, but Oracle recommends that you create sub-compartments to help manage your resources more efficiently.

1. Click the three-line menu, which is on the top left of the console. Scroll down till the bottom of the menu, click **Identity & Security -> Compartments**. Click the blue **Create Compartment** button to create a sub-compartment.

    ![Click Identity & Security then Compartments.](images/click-identity-and-security-then-compartments.png " ")

    ![Click the Create Compartment button.](images/click-create-compartment.png " ")

2. Give the compartment a name and description. Be sure your root compartment appears as the parent compartment. Press the blue **Create Compartment** button.

    ![Click the Create Compartment button.](images/click-create-compartment-button.png " ")

    The compartment is created, in which you will create an Autonomous Database instance in the next steps.

</if>
<if type="livelabs">
    ![](./images/livelabs-adwconfig.png)
</if>

3. Give basic information for the autonomous database:

<if type="freetier">
    - __Choose a compartment__ - Select the compartment you just created.
    - __Display Name__ - Enter a memorable name for the database for display purposes. For this lab, use __MyQuickStart__.
    - __Database Name__ - Use letters and numbers only, starting with a letter. Maximum length is 14 characters. (Underscores not initially supported.) For this lab, use __MYQUICKSTART__.

    ![Enter the required details.](./images/create-adb-screen-freetier.png " ")
</if>
<if type="livelabs">
    - __Choose a compartment__ - Use the default compartment created for you.
    - __Display Name__ - Enter a memorable name for the database for display purposes. For this lab, use **MyQuickStart**.
    - __Database Name__ - Use letters and numbers only, starting with a letter. Maximum length is 14 characters. (Underscores not initially supported.) For this lab, use __MOVIE+your user id__, for example, __MOVIE9352__.

    ![Enter the required details.](./images/livelabs-adwname.png " ")
</if>

4. Choose a workload type. Select the workload type for your database from the choices:

    - __Data Warehouse__ - For this lab, choose __Data Warehouse__ as the workload type.
    - __Transaction Processing__ - Or, you could have chosen Transaction Processing as the workload type.

    - __Auto Scaling__ - For this lab, keep auto scaling enabled, to enable the system to automatically use up to three times more CPU and IO resources to meet workload demand.
    - __New Database Preview__ - If a checkbox is available to preview a new database version, do NOT select it.

    > **Note:** You cannot scale up/down an Always Free autonomous database.

    ![Choose the remaining parameters.](./images/Picture100-26c.png " ")

7. Create administrator credentials:

    - __Password and Confirm Password__ - Specify the password for ADMIN user of the service instance. The password must meet the following requirements:
    - The password must be between 12 and 30 characters long and must include at least one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, and one numeric character.
    - The password cannot contain the username.
    - The password cannot contain the double quote (") character.
    - The password must be different from the last 4 passwords used.
    - The password must not be the same password that you set less than 24 hours ago.
    - Re-enter the password to confirm it. Make a note of this password.

    ![Enter password and confirm password.](./images/Picture100-26d.png " ")

8. Choose network access:
    - For this lab, accept the default, "Secure access from everywhere."
    - If you want to allow traffic only from the IP addresses and VCNs you specify - where access to the database from all public IPs or VCNs is blocked, select "Secure access from allowed IPs and VCNs only" in the Choose network access area.
    - If you want to restrict access to a private endpoint within an OCI VCN, select "Private endpoint access only" in the Choose network access area.
    - If the "Require mutual TLS (mTLS) authentication" option is selected, mTLS will be required to authenticate connections to your Autonomous Database. TLS connections allow you to connect to your Autonomous Database without a wallet, if you use a JDBC thin driver with JDK8 or above. See the [documentation for network options](https://docs.oracle.com/en/cloud/paas/autonomous-database/adbsa/support-tls-mtls-authentication.html#GUID-3F3F1FA4-DD7D-4211-A1D3-A74ED35C0AF5) for options to allow TLS, or to require only mutual TLS (mTLS) authentication.
