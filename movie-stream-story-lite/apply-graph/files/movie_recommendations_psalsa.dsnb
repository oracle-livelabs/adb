Set in Berlin during the Weimar Republic in 1931, under the presence of the growing Nazi Party, the film is loosely based on the 1966 Broadway musical Cabaret by Kander and Ebb, which was adapted from Christopher Isherwood's semi-autobiographical novel The Berlin Stories (1945) and the 1951 play I Am a Camera adapted from the same work.:609 Multiple numbers from the stage score were used for the film, which also featured three other songs by Kander and Ebb, including two written for the adaptation. In the traditional manner of musical theater, most major characters in the stage version sing to express their emotions and advance the plot; in the film, however, the musical numbers are entirely diegetic.:609 All of them take place inside the club,:609 with one exception: \\\"Tomorrow Belongs to Me\\\", the only song sung neither by the characters of the Master of Ceremonies or Sally Bowles.  After the box-office failure of his 1969 film version of Sweet Charity , Fosse bounced back with Cabaret in 1972, a year that made him one of the most honored working directors in Hollywood. The film also brought Minnelli, daughter of Judy Garland and Vincente Minnelli, her own first chance to sing on screen, and she won the Academy Award for Best Actress. With Academy Awards for Best Supporting Actor (Grey), Best Director (Fosse), Best Cinematography, Best Art Direction, Best Sound, Best Original Song Score and Adaptation, and Best Film Editing, Cabaret holds the record for most Oscars earned by a film not honored for Best Picture. It is listed as number 367 on Empire 's 500 greatest films of all time. Cabaret opened to glowing reviews and strong box office, eventually taking in more than $20 million. In addition to its eight Oscars, it won Best Picture citations from the National Board of Review and the Hollywood Foreign Press Association, and took Best Supporting Actor honors for Grey from the National Board of Review, the Hollywood Foreign Press, and the National Society of Film Critics. In 1995, Cabaret was the ninth live- action musical film selected by the Library of Congress for preservation in the United States National Film Registry as being deemed \\\"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\\\".\",\"CREW\":[{\"job\":\"producer\",\"names\":[\"Cy Feuer\"]},{\"job\":\"director\",\"names\":[\"Bob Fosse\"]},{\"job\":\"screenwriter\",\"names\":[\"Jay Presson Allen\",\"John Van Druten\"]}],\"CAST\":[\"Liza Minnelli\",\"Michael York\",\"Joel Grey\",\"Fritz Wepper\",\"Helmut Griem\",\"Marisa Berenson\",\"Ralf Wolter\",\"Elisabeth Neumann-Viertel\",\"Helen Vita\",\"Sigrid Richthofen\",\"Gerd Vespermann\",\"Georg Hartmann\",\"Ricky Renée\",\"Estrongo Nachama\",\"Ellen Umlauf\"],\"IMAGE_URL\":\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/3/3e/Original_movie_poster_for_Cabaret.jpg\",\"YEAR\":1972,\"AWARDS\":[\"National Film Registry\",\"Silver nugget for the best foreign film\",\"Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor\",\"Academy Award for Best Actress\",\"Academy Award for Best Director\",\"Academy Award for Best Cinematography\",\"Academy Award for Best Film Editing\",\"Academy Award for Best Production Design\",\"Academy Award for Best Original Song Score\",\"Academy Award for Best Sound\",\"National Board of Review: Top Ten Films\",\"National Board of Review Award for Best Film\"],\"OPENING_DATE\":\"1972-01-01T00:00:00\",\"STUDIO\":[\"Monogram Pictures\"],\"BUDGET\":4600000,\"MAIN_SUBJECT\":null,\"LIST_PRICE\":3.99,\"RUNTIME\":124,\"NOMINATIONS\":[\"Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor\",\"Academy Award for Best Actress\",\"Academy Award for Best Director\",\"Academy Award for Best Cinematography\",\"Academy Award for Best Film Editing\",\"Academy Award for Best Writing, Adapted Screenplay\",\"Academy Award for Best Picture\",\"Academy Award for Best Production Design\",\"Academy Award for Best Original Song Score\",\"Academy Award for Best Sound\"],\"GROSS\":42800000,\"TITLE\":\"Cabaret\"},\"labels\":[\"MOVIE\"]},{\"id\":\"MOVIE{\\\"MOVIE_ID\\\":855}\",\"properties\":{\"GENRES\":[\"Drama\",\"Biography\"],\"MOVIE_ID\":855,\"SUMMARY\":\"Dallas Buyers Club is a 2013 American biographical drama film written by Craig Borten and Melisa Wallack, and directed by Jean-Marc Vallée. The film tells the story of Ron Woodroof (Matthew McConaughey), an AIDS patient diagnosed in the mid 1980s when HIV/AIDS treatments were under-researched, while the disease was not understood and highly stigmatized. As part of the experimental AIDS treatment movement, he smuggled unapproved pharmaceutical drugs into Texas for treating his symptoms, and distributed them to fellow people with AIDS by establishing the \\\"Dallas Buyers Club\\\" while facing opposition from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Two fictional supporting characters, Dr. Eve Saks (Jennifer Garner), and Rayon (Jared Leto), were composite roles created from the writers' interviews with transgender AIDS patients, activists, and doctors. Presidential biographer and PEN-USA winner Bill Minutaglio wrote the first magazine profile of The Dallas Buyers Club in 1992. The article, which featured interviews with Woodroof and also recreated his dramatic international exploits, attracted widespread attention from filmmakers and journalists.  Screenwriter Borten interviewed Woodroof in 1992 and wrote the script, which he polished with writer Wallack in 2000, and then sold to producer Robbie Brenner. Several other actors, directors, and producers who were attached at various times to the development of the film left the project. Universal Pictures also tried to make the film, but did not. A couple of screenwriters wrote drafts that were rejected. In 2009, producer Brenner involved Matthew McConaughey, because of his Texas origins, the same as Woodroof's. Brenner selected the first draft, written by Borten and Wallack, for the film, and then Vallée was set to direct the film. Principal photography began on October 1, 2012, in New Orleans, Louisiana, continuing for 25 days of filming, which also included shooting in Baton Rouge. Brenner and Rachel Winter co-produced the film. The official soundtrack album featured various artists, and was released digitally on October 29, 2013, by the Relativity Music Group.  Dallas Buyers Club premiered at the 2013 Toronto International Film Festival and was released theatrically in the United States on November 1, 2013, by Focus Features, entering wide release on November 22. The film grossed over $52 million worldwide against a budget of $5 million. The film received widespread critical acclaim, resulting in numerous accolades. Most praised the performances of McConaughey and Leto, who received the Academy Award for Best Actor and for Best Supporting Actor, respectively, at the 86th Academy Awards, making this the first film since Mystic River (2003), and only the fifth film ever, to win both awards. The film also won the award for Best Makeup and Hairstyling, and garnered nominations for Best Picture, Best Original Screenplay, and Best Editing.\",\"CREW\":[{\"job\":\"producer\",\"names\":[\"Robbie Brenner\"]},{\"job\":\"director\",\"names\":[\"Jean-Marc Vallée\"]},{\"job\":\"screenwriter\",\"names\":[\"Craig Borten\"]}],\"CAST\":[\"Matthew McConaughey\",\"Jennifer Garner\",\"Jared Leto\",\"Bradford Cox\",\"Dallas Roberts\",\"Denis O'Hare\",\"Griffin Dunne\",\"Jane McNeill\",\"Kevin Rankin\",\"Michael O'Neill\",\"Steve Zahn\",\"Craig Borten\",\"J.

It stars Jennifer Grey as Frances \\\"Baby\\\" Houseman, a young woman who falls in love with dance instructor Johnny Castle (Patrick Swayze) at a vacation resort.  The film was based on screenwriter Eleanor Bergstein's own childhood. She originally wrote a screenplay for the Michael Douglas film It's My Turn , but ultimately ended up conceiving a story for a film which became Dirty Dancing. She finished the script in 1985, but management changes at MGM put the film in development hell.

Frozen II was green-lighted in March 2015, having previously undergone an internal debate over the possibility of disappointment to the first Frozen. With a darker tone compared to the first film, it made greater uses of complex visual computer effects that required additional assistance from several other animation departments due to its complication.

The screenplay, written by Joseph Stefano, was based on the 1959 novel of the same name by Robert Bloch. The film stars Anthony Perkins, Janet Leigh, Vera Miles, John Gavin and Martin Balsam. The plot centers on an encounter between on-the-run Marion Crane (Leigh) and shy motel proprietor Norman Bates (Perkins) and its aftermath, in which a private investigator (Balsam), Marion's lover Sam Loomis (Gavin) and her sister Lila (Miles) investigate the cause of her disappearance.   Psycho was seen as a departure from Hitchcock's previous film North by Northwest , as it was filmed on a lower budget in black-and-white by the crew of his television series Alfred Hitchcock Presents. The film was initially considered controversial and received mixed reviews, but audience interest and outstanding box-office returns prompted a major critical re-evaluation. Psycho was nominated for four Academy Awards, including Best Supporting Actress for Janet Leigh and Best Director for Hitchcock.  Psycho is now considered one of Hitchcock's best films, and is arguably his most famous work. It has been praised as a major work of cinematic art by international film critics and scholars due to its slick direction, tense atmosphere, impressive camerawork, a memorable score and iconic performances. Often ranked among the greatest films of all time, it set a new level of acceptability for violence, deviant behavior and sexuality in American films, and is widely considered to be the earliest example of the slasher film genre.  After Hitchcock's death in 1980, Universal Pictures produced follow-ups: three sequels, a remake, a made-for-television spin-off, and a prequel television series set in the 2010s.

It is the first installment in the Saw film series, and stars Whannell, Cary Elwes, Danny Glover, Monica Potter, Michael Emerson, Ken Leung, and Tobin Bell. The film tells a nonlinear narrative, revolving around the mystery of the Jigsaw Killer, who tests his victims' will to live by putting them through deadly \\\"games\\\" where they must inflict great physical pain upon themselves to survive. The frame story follows Jigsaw's latest victims (Whannell and Elwes), who awaken in a large dilapidated bathroom, with one being ordered to kill the other to save his own family.  The screenplay was written by Whannell, who co-created the story with Wan in their respective screenwriting debuts. It was originally written in 2001, but after failed attempts to get the script produced in Wan and Whannell's home country of Australia, they were urged to travel to Los Angeles. In order to help attract producers they shot a low-budget short film of the same name from a scene out of the script. This proved successful in 2003 as producers from Evolution Entertainment were immediately attached and also formed a horror genre production label, Twisted Pictures. The film was given a small budget of $1.2 million and was shot in 18 days.  Saw was first screened on January 19, 2004, before being released in North America on October 29, 2004, by Lions Gate Films.

The film follows San Francisco police detective Nick Curran (Michael Douglas), who is investigating the brutal murder of a wealthy rock star. During the investigation, Curran becomes involved in a torrid and intense relationship with the prime suspect, Catherine Tramell (Sharon Stone), an enigmatic writer.  Eszterhas developed the script in the 1980s. It became a subject of a bidding war until Carolco Pictures acquired the rights to the film. From there, Verhoeven signed on to direct and Douglas and Stone joined the project, after many actresses were considered for the role of Tramell. Before its release, Basic Instinct generated controversy due to its overt sexuality and violence, including a rape scene. Gay rights activists criticized the film's depiction of homosexual relationships and the portrayal of a bisexual woman as a murderous psychopath. In one scene, Stone's vulva was filmed as she crossed her legs, which she claims was done without her knowledge.   Basic Instinct premiered in Los Angeles on March 18, 1992, and was released in the United States by TriStar Pictures on March 20, 1992. It received mixed reviews from critics, who praised the performances of its cast, original score, and editing, but criticized its writing and character development. Despite these reviews and public protest, Basic Instinct was a box office success, grossing $352 million worldwide, making it the fourth highest- grossing film of 1992 behind Disney's Aladdin , The Bodyguard , and Home Alone 2: Lost in New York. Several versions of the film have been released on videocassette, DVD, and Blu-ray including a director's cut with extended footage previously unseen in North American cinemas.  The film was later recognized for its groundbreaking depictions of sexuality in mainstream Hollywood cinema, and was described by one scholar as \\\"a neo- film noir masterpiece that plays with, and transgresses, the narrative rules of film noir.\\\" A 2006 sequel (14 years later), Basic Instinct 2 , also starred Stone and was made without Verhoeven's involvement, but received negative reviews and was relatively unsuccessful.\",\"CREW\":[{\"job\":\"producer\",\"names\":[\"Mario Kassar\",\"Alan Marshall\"]},{\"job\":\"director\",\"names\":[\"Paul Verhoeven\"]},{\"job\":\"screenwriter\",\"names\":[\"Joe Eszterhas\"]}],\"CAST\":[\"Michael Douglas\",\"Sharon Stone\",\"George Dzundza\",\"Jeanne Tripplehorn\",\"Daniel von Bargen\",\"Stephen Tobolowsky\",\"Dorothy Malone\",\"James Rebhorn\",\"Wayne Knight\",\"Bruce A.

It is based on the 1979 novel Nothing Lasts Forever by Roderick Thorp, and it stars Bruce Willis, Alan Rickman, Alexander Godunov, and Bonnie Bedelia. Die Hard follows New York City police detective John McClane (Willis) who is caught up in a terrorist takeover of a Los Angeles skyscraper while visiting his estranged wife. Reginald VelJohnson, William Atherton, Paul Gleason, and Hart Bochner feature in supporting roles.  Stuart was hired by 20th Century Fox to adapt Thorp's novel into a screenplay in 1987. His finished draft was greenlit immediately by Fox, who were eager for a summer blockbuster the following year. The role of McClane was turned down by a host of the decade's most popular actors, including Arnold Schwarzenegger and Sylvester Stallone. Known mainly for work on television, Willis was paid $5 million for his involvement, placing him among Hollywood's highest-paid actors. The deal was seen as a poor investment by industry professionals and attracted significant controversy before its release. Filming took place between November 1987 and March 1988, on a $25 million–$35 million budget and almost entirely on location in and around Fox Plaza in Los Angeles.  Expectations for Die Hard were low; some marketing efforts omitted Willis's image, ostensibly because the marketing team determined that the setting was as important as McClane. Upon its release in July 1988, initial reviews were mixed: criticism was focused on its violence, plot, and Willis's performance, while McTiernan's direction and Rickman's charismatic portrayal of the villain Hans Gruber were praised. Defying predictions, Die Hard grossed approximately $140 million, becoming the year's tenth-highest-grossing film and the highest-grossing action film. Receiving four Academy Award nominations, it elevated Willis to leading-man status and made Rickman a celebrity.  Die Hard has been critically re-evaluated and is now considered one of the greatest action films, and is also often named one of the best Christmas films. It revitalized the action genre, largely due to its depiction of McClane as a vulnerable and fallible protagonist, in contrast to the muscle- bound and invincible heroes of other films of the period. Retrospective commentators also identified and analyzed its thematic concerns, including vengeance, masculinity, gender roles, and American anxieties over foreign influences. The film produced a host of imitators; the term \\\" Die Hard \\\" became a shorthand for plots featuring overwhelming odds in a restricted environment, such as \\\" Die Hard on a bus\\\". It created a franchise comprising the sequels Die Hard 2 (1990), Die Hard with a Vengeance (1995), Live Free or Die Hard (2007), and A Good Day to Die Hard (2013), plus video games, comics, and other merchandise. Deemed \\\"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\\\" by the United States Library of Congress, Die Hard was selected for preservation in the National Film Registry in 2017.\",\"CREW\":[{\"job\":\"producer\",\"names\":[\"Joel Silver\",\"Lawrence Gordon\"]},{\"job\":\"executive producer\",\"names\":[\"Charles Gordon\"]},{\"job\":\"director\",\"names\":[\"John McTiernan\"]},{\"job\":\"screenwriter\",\"names\":[\"Steven E. de Souza\",\"Jeb Stuart\",\"Roderick Thorp\"]}],\"CAST\":[\"Bruce Willis\",\"Alexander Godunov\",\"Bonnie Bedelia\",\"Reginald VelJohnson\",\"William Atherton\",\"Paul Gleason\",\"Al Leong\",\"Clarence Gilyard\",\"Robert Davi\",\"James Shigeta\",\"Anthony Peck\",\"Dennis Hayden\",\"Grand L.

Released and taking place nineteen years after the previous film, it is set in 1957, pitting Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford) against Soviet agents led by Irina Spalko (Cate Blanchett)—searching for a telepathic crystal skull. Jones is aided by his former lover, Marion Ravenwood (Karen Allen), and her son, Mutt Williams (Shia LaBeouf). Ray Winstone, John Hurt, and Jim Broadbent are also part of the supporting cast.  Screenwriters Jeb Stuart, Jeffrey Boam, Frank Darabont, George Lucas and Jeff Nathanson wrote drafts before David Koepp's script satisfied the producers. The filmmakers intended to pay tribute to the science fiction B-movies of the 1950s era. Shooting began on June 18, 2007, at various locations in New Mexico, New Haven, Connecticut, Hawaii, and Fresno, California, as well as on sound stages in Los Angeles. To maintain aesthetic continuity with the previous films, the crew relied on traditional stunt work instead of computer- generated stunt doubles, and cinematographer Janusz Kamiński studied Douglas Slocombe's style from the previous films.  The film premiered at the 2008 Cannes Film Festival on May 18, 2008, and was released worldwide on May 22, 2008. It received generally positive reviews from critics but more polarized responses from audiences. Critics praised the film for its visual effects, performances, action sequences, John Williams' musical score, and the costume design, but criticized the dialogue, storyline, pacing, and overuse of CGI. It was also a financial success like the previous three films in the series, grossing over $790 million worldwide, becoming the franchise's highest-grossing film when not adjusted for inflation, as well as the second-highest-grossing film of 2008.  Paramount sold the distribution rights of future films in the Indiana Jones franchise to The Walt Disney Company in December 2013, following its acquisition of Lucasfilm in October 2012, with Paramount still retaining this film and its predecessors and receiving \\\"financial participation\\\" from any additional films beginning with the fifth film, which is scheduled for release on July 29, 2022, with Ford set to reprise his role.\",\"CREW\":[{\"job\":\"producer\",\"names\":[\"Frank Marshall\",\"George Lucas\",\"Kathleen Kennedy\"]},{\"job\":\"executive producer\",\"names\":[\"George Lucas\"]},{\"job\":\"director\",\"names\":[\"Steven Spielberg\"]},{\"job\":\"screenwriter\",\"names\":[\"David Koepp\"]}],\"CAST\":[\"Harrison Ford\",\"Shia LaBeouf\",\"Karen Allen\",\"Ray Winstone\",\"John Hurt\",\"Jim Broadbent\",\"Igor Jijikine\",\"Cate Blanchett\",\"Alan Dale\",\"Neil Flynn\",\"Robert Baker\",\"V.J.

Starring John Travolta, Samuel L. Jackson, Bruce Willis, Tim Roth, Ving Rhames, and Uma Thurman, it tells several stories of criminal Los Angeles. The title refers to the pulp magazines and hardboiled crime novels popular during the mid-20th century, known for their graphic violence and punchy dialogue.  Tarantino wrote Pulp Fiction in 1992 and 1993, incorporating scenes that Avary originally wrote for True Romance (1993). Its plot occurs out of chronological order. The film is also self-referential from its opening moments, beginning with a title card that gives two dictionary definitions of \\\"pulp\\\". Considerable screen time is devoted to monologues and casual conversations with eclectic dialogue revealing each character's perspectives on several subjects, and the film features an ironic combination of humor and strong violence. TriStar Pictures reportedly turned down the script as \\\"too demented\\\". Then Miramax co-chairman Harvey Weinstein was enthralled, however, and the film became the first that Miramax fully financed.  Pulp Fiction won the Palme d'Or at the 1994 Cannes Film Festival, and was a major critical and commercial success. It was nominated for seven awards at the 67th Academy Awards, including Best Picture, and won Best Original Screenplay; it earned Travolta, Jackson, and Thurman Academy Award nominations and boosted their careers. Its development, marketing, distribution, and profitability had a sweeping effect on independent cinema.  Pulp Fiction is widely regarded as Tarantino's masterpiece, with particular praise for its screenwriting. The self-reflexivity, unconventional structure, and extensive homage and pastiche have led critics to describe it as a touchstone of postmodern film. It is often considered a cultural watershed, influencing films and other media that adopted elements of its style. The cast was also widely praised, with Travolta, Thurman and Jackson earning particular acclaim. In 2008, Entertainment Weekly named it the best film since 1983 and it has appeared on many critics' lists of the greatest films ever made. In 2013, Pulp Fiction was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as \\\"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\\\".\",\"CREW\":[{\"job\":\"producer\",\"names\":[\"Lawrence Bender\"]},{\"job\":\"executive producer\",\"names\":[\"Michael Shamberg\",\"Stacey Sher\",\"Danny DeVito\"]},{\"job\":\"director\",\"names\":[\"Quentin Tarantino\"]},{\"job\":\"screenwriter\",\"names\":[\"Quentin Tarantino\",\"Roger Avary\"]}],\"CAST\":[\"Bruce Willis\",\"John Travolta\",\"Rosanna Arquette\",\"Uma Thurman\",\"Samuel L.

It is the second Spider-Man film reboot and the 16th film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). The film was directed by Jon Watts, from a screenplay by the writing teams of Jonathan Goldstein and John Francis Daley, Watts and Christopher Ford, and Chris McKenna and Erik Sommers. Tom Holland stars as Peter Parker / Spider-Man, alongside Michael Keaton, Jon Favreau, Gwyneth Paltrow, Zendaya, Donald Glover, Jacob Batalon, Laura Harrier, Tony Revolori, Bokeem Woodbine, Tyne Daly, Marisa Tomei, and Robert Downey Jr. In Spider-Man: Homecoming , Peter Parker tries to balance high school life with being Spider-Man while facing the Vulture.  In February 2015, Marvel Studios and Sony reached a deal to share the character rights of Spider-Man, integrating the character into the established MCU. The following June, Holland was cast as the title character and Watts was hired to direct. This was followed shortly by the hiring of Daley and Goldstein. In April 2016, the film's title was revealed, along with additional cast, including Downey in his MCU role of Tony Stark / Iron Man. Principal photography began in June 2016 at Pinewood Atlanta Studios in Fayette County, Georgia, and continued in Atlanta, Los Angeles, and New York City. The other screenwriters were revealed during filming, which concluded in Berlin in October 2016. The production team made efforts to differentiate the film from previous Spider-Man films.  Spider-Man: Homecoming premiered in Hollywood on June 28, 2017, and was released in the United States on July 7, as part of Phase Three of the MCU. Homecoming grossed over $880 million worldwide, becoming the second-most- successful Spider-Man film and the sixth-highest-grossing film of 2017. It received praise for the light tone and focus on Parker's high school life, and the performances of Holland and Keaton. A sequel, Spider-Man: Far From Home , was released on July 2, 2019.

The film's title derives from a discussion in the Tao Te Ching that likens people to the ancient Chinese ceremonial straw dog, being of ceremonial worth, but afterwards discarded with indifference.  The film is noted for its violent concluding sequences and two complicated rape scenes, which were subject to censorship by numerous film rating boards. Released theatrically in the same year as A Clockwork Orange , The French Connection , and Dirty Harry , the film sparked heated controversy over a perceived increase of violence in films generally.  The film premiered in the UK in November 1971. Although controversial at the time, Straw Dogs is considered by some critics to be one of Peckinpah's greatest films, and was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Music (Original Dramatic Score).

The film stars Arnold Schwarzenegger, Linda Hamilton, Robert Patrick, Edward Furlong and Joe Morton as its principal cast. It is the sequel to the 1984 film The Terminator , as well as the second installment in the Terminator franchise. Terminator 2 follows Sarah Connor (Hamilton) and her ten-year-old son John (Furlong) as they are pursued by a new, more advanced Terminator: the liquid metal, shapeshifting T-1000 (Patrick), sent back in time to kill John and prevent him from becoming the leader of the human resistance. A second, less-advanced Terminator (Schwarzenegger) is also sent back in time by the \\\"Resistance\\\" to protect John.  While talks of a follow-up to The Terminator arose following its release, its development was stalled due to technical limitations regarding computer- generated imagery, a vital aspect of the film, and legal issues with original producer Hemdale Film Corporation, who controlled half of the franchise rights. In 1990, Carolco Pictures acquired the rights from Hemdale and production immediately began, with Schwarzenegger, Hamilton, and Cameron returning. Principal photography began in October 1990 and lasted until March 1991. Its visual effects saw breakthroughs in computer-generated imagery, including the first use of natural human motion for a computer-generated character and the first partially computer-generated main character. At the time of its release, with a budget of $94–102 million, Terminator 2: Judgment Day was the most expensive film ever made.  Terminator 2: Judgment Day was released in the United States on July 3, 1991 by TriStar Pictures. It was a critical success upon its release, with praise going towards the performances of its cast, the action scenes, and its visual effects. Regarded as superior to the original film and one of the best sequels ever made, the film influenced popular culture, especially the use of visual effects in films. It grossed $520 million worldwide, becoming the highest- grossing film of 1991 and of Schwarzenegger's career. It received several accolades, including Academy Awards for Best Sound Effects Editing, Best Sound, Best Makeup, and Best Visual Effects, and the Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation - Long Form.  Other films followed: two sequels, Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines in 2003 and Terminator Salvation in 2009; a reboot, Terminator Genisys in 2015; and the Cameron-produced film Terminator: Dark Fate in 2019 which was intended to be an alternate sequel and retcon from Rise of the Machines onwards.

It stars John Belushi as \\\"Joliet\\\" Jake Blues and Dan Aykroyd as his brother Elwood, characters developed from the recurring musical sketch \\\"The Blues Brothers\\\" on NBC variety series Saturday Night Live. The film is set in and around Chicago, Illinois, where it was filmed, and the screenplay was written by Aykroyd and Landis. It features musical numbers by rhythm and blues (R&B), soul, and blues singers James Brown, Cab Calloway, Aretha Franklin, Ray Charles, Chaka Khan, and John Lee Hooker. It features non- musical supporting performances by Carrie Fisher, Henry Gibson, Charles Napier and John Candy.  The story is a tale of redemption for paroled convict Jake and his blood brother Elwood, who set out on \\\"a mission from God\\\" to save from foreclosure the Catholic orphanage in which they were raised. To do so, they must reunite their R&B band and organize a performance to earn $5,000 needed to pay the orphanage's property tax bill. Along the way, they are targeted by a homicidal \\\"mystery woman\\\", Neo-Nazis, and a country and western band—all while being relentlessly pursued by the police.  Universal Studios, which had won the bidding war for the film, was hoping to take advantage of Belushi's popularity in the wake of Saturday Night Live , the film Animal House , and The Blues Brothers' musical success; it soon found itself unable to control production costs. The start of filming was delayed when Aykroyd, who was new to film screenwriting, took six months to deliver a long and unconventional script that Landis had to rewrite before production, which began without a final budget. On location in Chicago, Belushi's partying and drug use caused lengthy and costly delays that, along with the destructive car chases depicted onscreen, made the final film one of the most expensive comedies ever produced.  Due to concerns that the film would fail, its initial bookings were less than half of those similar films normally received. Released in the United States on June 20, 1980, it received mostly positive reviews. It earned just under $5 million in its opening weekend and grossed over $115 million in theaters worldwide before its release on home video. It has become a cult film, spawning the sequel Blues Brothers 2000 (1998), which was a critical and commercial failure.  In 2020, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being \\\"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.\\\"\",\"CREW\":[{\"job\":\"producer\",\"names\":[\"Bernie Brillstein\",\"George Folsey\",\"Robert K.

The first installment in the Before trilogy, it follows Jesse (Ethan Hawke) and Céline (Julie Delpy) as they meet on a Eurail train and disembark in Vienna to spend the night together.  Inspired by personal experiences, Linklater collaborated with Ximena Hernandez to develop the screenplay, who previously appeared in his films Slacker (1991) and Dazed and Confused (1993). Casting was extensive; it took nine months for Hawke and Delpy to be cast, with the pair also contributing uncredited rewrites. Principal photography took place entirely in Vienna.  The plot is considered minimalistic, consisting mostly of monologues and casual conversation with extended dialogue as the characters navigate Vienna. Their contrasting ideas and perspectives on life and love are detailed, with Jesse a romantic disguised as a cynic, and Céline seemingly a romantic. Before Sunrise also explores time and self-discovery.  Before Sunrise premiered at the Sundance Film Festival on January 19, 1995, and was theatrically released eight days later. A modest commercial success, grossing $5.5 million against a $2.5 million budget, it received critical acclaim, particularly for its exploration of postmodern romance, Linklater's direction, and acting performances. Before Sunrise also received a rating of 100% on Rotten Tomatoes, and appeared on many critics' lists of the greatest films of the year.

It employs disturbing, violent images to comment on psychiatry, juvenile delinquency, youth gangs, and other social, political, and economic subjects in a dystopian near-future Britain.  Alex (Malcolm McDowell), the central character, is a charismatic, antisocial delinquent whose interests include classical music (especially Beethoven), committing rape, theft and what is termed \\\"ultra-violence\\\". He leads a small gang of thugs, Pete (Michael Tarn), Georgie (James Marcus), and Dim (Warren Clarke), whom he calls his droogs (from the Russian word друг, \\\"friend\\\", \\\"buddy\\\"). The film chronicles the horrific crime spree of his gang, his capture, and attempted rehabilitation via an experimental psychological conditioning technique (the \\\"Ludovico Technique\\\") promoted by the Minister of the Interior (Anthony Sharp). Alex narrates most of the film in Nadsat, a fractured adolescent slang composed of Slavic (especially Russian), English, and Cockney rhyming slang.  The film premiered in New York City on 19 December 1971 and was released in the United Kingdom on 13 January 1972. The film was met with polarised reviews from critics, and was also heavily controversial due to its depictions of graphic violence.

It tells the story of Elliott, a boy who befriends an extraterrestrial, dubbed E.T., who is stranded on Earth. The film stars Dee Wallace, Henry Thomas, Peter Coyote, Robert MacNaughton, and Drew Barrymore.  The concept was based on an imaginary friend Spielberg created after his parents' divorce. In 1980, Spielberg met Mathison and developed a new story from the failed project Night Skies. Filming took place from September to December 1981 on a budget of $10.5 million. Unlike most films, it was shot in rough chronological order, to facilitate convincing emotional performances from the young cast. The animatronics of E.T. were designed by Carlo Rambaldi.  Released on June 11, 1982, by Universal Pictures, E.T. was an immediate blockbuster, surpassing Star Wars to become the highest-grossing film of all time—a record it held for eleven years until Jurassic Park , another Spielberg film, surpassed it. E.T. was widely acclaimed by critics and is regarded as one of the greatest films of all time, and it won four Oscars at the 55th Academy Awards: Best Original Score, Best Visual Effects, Best Sound and Best Sound Editing. It was re-released in 1985, and again in 2002, to celebrate its 20th anniversary, with altered shots, visual effects, and additional scenes.

It stars Winona Ryder, Christian Slater, Shannen Doherty, Lisanne Falk, Kim Walker, and Penelope Milford. The film portrays four teenage girls — three of whom are named Heather — in a clique at an Ohio high school, one of whose lives is disrupted by the arrival of a misanthrope intent on murdering the popular students and staging their deaths as suicides.  Waters wrote Heathers as a spec script and originally wanted Stanley Kubrick to direct the film, out of admiration for Kubrick's own black comedy film Dr. Strangelove. Waters intended for the film to contrast the more optimistic teen movies of the era, particularly those written by John Hughes, by presenting a cynical depiction of high school imbued with dark satire.   Heathers premiered on January 21, 1989 at the Sundance Film Festival, and was theatrically released in the United States on March 31, 1989 by New World Pictures. Despite being a box office flop, the film received critical acclaim and won the Independent Spirit Award for Best First Feature. For his screenplay, Waters received the Edgar Award for Best Motion Picture Screenplay. It has since become popular as a cult film and is regarded as one of the greatest coming-of-age films of all time.

Produced by Marvel Studios and distributed by Paramount Pictures, it is the first film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). Directed by Jon Favreau from a screenplay by the writing teams of Mark Fergus and Hawk Ostby, and Art Marcum and Matt Holloway, the film stars Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark / Iron Man alongside Terrence Howard, Jeff Bridges, Shaun Toub, and Gwyneth Paltrow. In the film, following his escape from captivity by a terrorist group, world famous industrialist and master engineer Tony Stark builds a mechanized suit of armor and becomes the superhero Iron Man.  A film featuring the character was in development at Universal Pictures, 20th Century Fox, and New Line Cinema at various times since 1990, before Marvel Studios reacquired the rights in 2006. Marvel put the project in production as its first self-financed film, with Paramount Pictures distributing. Favreau signed on as director in April 2006, and faced opposition from Marvel when trying to cast Downey in the title role; the actor was signed in September. Filming took place from March to June 2007, primarily in California to differentiate the film from numerous other superhero stories that are set in New York City-esque environments. During filming, the actors were free to create their own dialogue because pre-production was focused on the story and action. Rubber and metal versions of the armor, created by Stan Winston's company, were mixed with computer-generated imagery to create the title character.  Iron Man premiered in Sydney on April 14, 2008, and was released in the United States on May 2, as the first film in Phase One of the MCU. It grossed over $585 million, becoming the eighth-highest grossing film of 2008. The film received praise from critics, especially for Downey's performance. It was selected by the American Film Institute as one of the ten best films of 2008 and received two nominations at the 81st Academy Awards for Best Sound Editing and Best Visual Effects. Two sequels have been released: Iron Man 2 (2010) and Iron Man 3 (2013).\",\"CREW\":[{\"job\":\"producer\",\"names\":[\"Avi Arad\",\"Kevin Feige\"]},{\"job\":\"executive producer\",\"names\":[\"Peter Billingsley\",\"Jon Favreau\",\"Stan Lee\",\"David Maisel\",\"Louis D'Esposito\",\"Ari Arad\"]},{\"job\":\"director\",\"names\":[\"Jon Favreau\",\"Nick Cassavetes\"]},{\"job\":\"screenwriter\",\"names\":[\"Mark Fergus\",\"Hawk Ostby\",\"Art Marcum\",\"Matt Holloway\",\"Jon Favreau\"]}],\"CAST\":[\"Robert Downey Jr.\",\"Terrence Howard\",\"Jeff Bridges\",\"Gwyneth Paltrow\",\"Shaun Toub\",\"Faran Tahir\",\"Leslie Bibb\",\"Clark Gregg\",\"Bill Smitrovich\",\"Paul Bettany\",\"Jon Favreau\",\"Samuel L.

Prince Caspian , a British-American production, is the last Narnia film to be co-produced by Walt Disney Pictures, as Disney's 20th Century Fox became the distributor for the next film The Chronicles of Narnia: The Voyage of the Dawn Treader due to budgetary disputes between Disney and Walden Media, but as a result of Disney eventually purchasing Fox on March 20, 2019, Disney now owns the rights to all three Narnia movies. Work on the script began before The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe was released, so filming could begin before the actors grew too old for their parts.  Director Andrew Adamson wanted to make the film more spectacular than the first, and created an action sequence not in the novel. The Narnians were designed to look wilder as they have been hiding from persecution, stressing the darker tone of the sequel. The filmmakers also took a Spanish influence for the antagonistic race of the Telmarines. Filming began in February 2007 in New Zealand, but unlike the previous film, the majority of shooting took place in Central Europe, because of the larger sets available in those countries. To keep costs down, Adamson chose to base post-production in the UK, because of recent tax credits there.  The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian premiered on May 7, 2008 at the Ziegfeld Theatre in New York City, before it was theatrically released on May 16 in the United States and on June 26 in the United Kingdom. The film received mostly positive reviews from film critics. Many praised the performances and visual effects; however, the film's darker tone and mature themes drew polarizing opinions. It was a moderate success at the box office, grossing $55 million during its opening weekend. By the end of its theatrical run, it had grossed over $419.7 million worldwide. The film became the 10th- highest-grossing film worldwide in 2008.\",\"CREW\":[{\"job\":\"producer\",\"names\":[\"Mark Johnson\",\"Andrew Adamson\",\"Philip Steuer\"]},{\"job\":\"executive producer\",\"names\":[\"Perry Moore\"]},{\"job\":\"director\",\"names\":[\"Andrew Adamson\"]},{\"job\":\"screenwriter\",\"names\":[\"Andrew Adamson\",\"Christopher Markus\",\"Stephen McFeely\"]}],\"CAST\":null,\"IMAGE_URL\":\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/c/c8/Principe_Caspain_poster.jpg\",\"YEAR\":2008,\"AWARDS\":null,\"OPENING_DATE\":\"2008-05-16T00:00:00\",\"STUDIO\":[\"Walden Media\",\"Walt Disney Pictures\",\"Mark Johnson\",\"Silverbell Films\"],\"BUDGET\":225000000,\"MAIN_SUBJECT\":null,\"LIST_PRICE\":4.99,\"RUNTIME\":140,\"NOMINATIONS\":null,\"GROSS\":419700000,\"TITLE\":\"The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian\"},\"labels\":[\"MOVIE\"]},{\"id\":\"CUSTOMER_SAMPLE{\\\"CUST_ID\\\":1010303}\",\"properties\":{\"GENDER\":\"Male\",\"RENT_OWN\":\"Rent\",\"STREET_ADDRESS\":\"34 Salem St\",\"CITY\":\"Medford\",\"INCOME_LEVEL\":\"B: 30,000 - 49,999\",\"CUST_ID\":1010303,\"YRS_CURRENT_EMPLOYER\":0,\"COUNTRY\":\"United States\",\"CREDIT_BALANCE\":1290,\"LATE_MORT_RENT_PMTS\":0,\"FULL_TIME\":\"Yes\",\"CONTINENT\":\"North America\",\"FIRST_NAME\":\"Emilio\",\"WORK_EXPERIENCE\":2,\"NUM_MORTGAGES\":0,\"POSTAL_CODE\":\"02155\",\"EDUCATION\":\"Bachelors\",\"MORTGAGE_AMT\":0,\"STATE_PROVINCE\":\"Massachusetts\",\"YRS_CUSTOMER\":3,\"PROMOTION_RESPONSE\":0,\"PET\":\"Unknown\",\"INCOME\":30632.5,\"EMAIL\":\"emilio.welch@oraclemail.com\",\"INSUFF_FUNDS_INCIDENTS\":0,\"MARITAL_STATUS\":\"M\",\"LAST_NAME\":\"Welch\",\"YRS_RESIDENCE\":3,\"JOB_TYPE\":\"Labor\",\"SEGMENT_ID\":4,\"HOUSEHOLD_SIZE\":2,\"COMMUTE_DISTANCE\":22,\"COUNTRY_CODE\":\"US\",\"NUM_CARS\":1,\"LOC_LONG\":-71.1084,\"LOC_LAT\":42.41849,\"AGE\":28},\"labels\":[\"CUSTOMER_SAMPLE\"]},{\"id\":\"MOVIE{\\\"MOVIE_ID\\\":983}\",\"properties\":{\"GENRES\":[\"Action\",\"Drama\",\"Crime\",\"Comedy\",\"Thriller\"],\"MOVIE_ID\":983,\"SUMMARY\":\"Dog Day Afternoon is a 1975 American biographical crime drama film directed by Sidney Lumet and produced by Martin Bregman and Martin Elfand.

Kluge and Thomas Moore. The feature chronicled the 1972 robbery and hostage situation led by John Wojtowicz and Salvatore Naturile at a Chase Manhattan branch in Brooklyn.  Elfand brought Bregman's attention to the article, who proceeded to negotiate a deal with Warner Bros and clear the rights to use the story. Pierson conducted his research and wrote a script that centered the story of the robbery around Wojtowicz. The cast was selected by Lumet and Pacino, with the latter selecting past co-stars from his Off-Broadway plays. Filming took place between September and November 1974, and the production was finished three weeks ahead of schedule.  Upon theatrical release on September 21, 1975, Dog Day Afternoon was a critical and box office success. The film was nominated for six Academy Awards and seven Golden Globe Awards and won the Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay.

It stars Spencer Tracy, Sidney Poitier, and Katharine Hepburn, and features Hepburn's niece Katharine Houghton.  The film was one of the few films of the time to depict an interracial marriage in a positive light, as interracial marriage historically had been illegal in most states of the United States. It was still illegal in 17 states—mostly Southern states—until June 12, 1967, six months before the film was released. Roughly two weeks after Tracy filmed his final scene (and two days after his death), anti-miscegenation laws were struck down by the Supreme Court in Loving v. Virginia.  The film is notable for being the ninth and final on-screen pairing of Tracy and Hepburn, with filming ending just 17 days before Tracy's death. Hepburn never saw the completed film, saying the memories of Tracy were too painful. The film was released in December 1967, six months after his death.  In 1998, the film was ranked #99 on the 100 Years...100 Movies list, by the American Film Institute.

They then prepare to fight the East India Trading Company, led by Cutler Beckett, who controls Davy Jones and plans to extinguish piracy forever.  Two sequels to Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl were conceived in 2004, with Elliott and Rossio developing a story arc that would span both films.

It is the sixth and final installment in the original Superman film series and serves as an homage sequel to Superman (1978) and Superman II (1980), while ignoring the events of Superman III (1983), Supergirl (1984), and Superman IV: The Quest for Peace (1987). The film stars Brandon Routh as Clark Kent/Superman, Kate Bosworth as Lois Lane, Kevin Spacey as Lex Luthor, with James Marsden, Frank Langella, and Parker Posey. The film tells the story of the title character returning to Earth after a five-year absence. He finds that his love interest Lois Lane has moved on with her life, and that his archenemy Lex Luthor is plotting a scheme to kill Superman and reshape North America.  After a series of unsuccessful projects to resurrect Superman on screen following the critical and financial failure of The Quest for Peace , Warner Bros. Pictures hired Bryan Singer to direct and develop Superman Returns in July 2004. The majority of principal photography took place at Fox Studios Australia, Sydney, while the visual effects sequences were created by a number of studios, including Sony Pictures Imageworks, Rhythm & Hues, Framestore, Rising Sun Pictures, and The Orphanage; filming began in March 2005 and ended in November.  Upon release, the film received generally positive reviews from critics, who complimented its visual effects, story, musical score, and the performances of Routh and Spacey. However, it received criticism focusing on its runtime and lack of action sequences. Despite its critical reception, Warner Bros. was disappointed with the worldwide box office return of the film, cancelling a sequel planned for 2009 as a result. The Superman film series was completely rebooted in 2013 with Man of Steel , directed by Zack Snyder, starring Henry Cavill as Superman, and launching the DC Extended Universe.

It is the fourth theatrical Spider-Man film produced by Columbia Pictures and Marvel Entertainment, a reboot of the series following Sam Raimi's 2002–2007 Spider- Man trilogy, and the first of the two The Amazing Spider-Man films. The film was directed by Marc Webb and written by James Vanderbilt, Alvin Sargent and Steve Kloves from a story by Vanderbilt, and stars Andrew Garfield, Emma Stone, Rhys Ifans, Denis Leary, Campbell Scott, Irrfan Khan, Martin Sheen, and Sally Field. In the film, after Peter Parker is bitten by a genetically altered spider, he gains newfound, spider-like powers and ventures out to save the city from the machinations of a mysterious reptilian foe.  Development of the film began with the cancellation of Spider-Man 4 in January 2010, ending director Sam Raimi's Spider-Man film series that originally featured Tobey Maguire as the titular superhero. Columbia Pictures opted to reboot the franchise with the same production team along with Vanderbilt to stay on with writing the next Spider-Man film, while Sargent and Kloves helped with the script as well. During pre-production, the main characters were cast in 2010. New designs were introduced from the comics, such as artificial web-shooters. Using Red Digital Cinema Camera Company's RED Epic camera, principal photography started in December 2010 in Los Angeles before moving to New York City. The film entered post-production in April 2011. 3ality Technica provided 3D image processing, while Sony Pictures Imageworks handled CGI effects. This was also the final American film to be scored by James Horner and released during his lifetime, three years before his death on June 22, 2015 from an aircraft accident, as well as the penultimate film for both production designer J. Michael Riva and one of the producers Laura Ziskin, who died on June 7, 2012 and June 12, 2011, respectively. J. Michael Riva's last film as production designer was Django Unchained , released five months later and Ziskin's last film as producer was The Butler , released one year later in 2013.  Sony Pictures Entertainment built a promotional website, releasing many previews and launched a viral marketing campaign, among other moves. Tie-ins included a video game by Beenox and Activision. The film premiered on June 30, 2012 in Tokyo, and was released in the United States on July 3, ten years after the release of Spider-Man (2002), in 2D, 3D, and IMAX 3D formats. The reboot received a mostly positive reception, with critics praising Andrew Garfield's performance, the visual style, James Horner's musical score, and the realistic re-imagining and portrayal of the title character, but criticized the number of underdeveloped story-lines, noting the film's deleted scenes.

Produced by Marvel Studios and distributed by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures, it is the 21st film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). The film was written and directed by Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck, with Geneva Robertson-Dworet also contributing to the screenplay. Brie Larson stars as Carol Danvers, alongside Samuel L. Jackson, Ben Mendelsohn, Djimon Hounsou, Lee Pace, Lashana Lynch, Gemma Chan, Annette Bening, Clark Gregg, and Jude Law. Set in 1995, the story follows Danvers as she becomes Captain Marvel after Earth is caught in the center of a galactic conflict between two alien civilizations.  Development of the film began by May 2013. It was officially announced in October 2014 as Marvel Studios' first female-led superhero film. Nicole Perlman and Meg LeFauve were hired to write the film the following April after submitting separate takes on the character, and borrowed elements from Roy Thomas' 1971 \\\"Kree–Skrull War\\\" comic book storyline. Larson was announced as Danvers at the 2016 San Diego Comic-Con, with Boden and Fleck hired to direct in April 2017. Robertson-Dworet was soon hired to re-write the script, with the rest of the cast added by the start of filming. Location shooting began in January 2018, with principal photography starting that March in California and concluding in Louisiana in July 2018. Several actors reprise their roles from previous MCU films in Captain Marvel , including Jackson and Gregg who were digitally de-aged in post-production to reflect the film's 1990s setting.  Captain Marvel premiered in London on February 27, 2019, and was theatrically released in the United States on March 8, as part of Phase Three of the MCU. The film grossed over $1.1 billion worldwide, making it the first female-led superhero film to pass the billion-dollar mark. It became the fifth-highest-grossing film of 2019 and was the 23rd-highest-grossing film of all time during its theatrical run. The film received praise for the performances of the cast, particularly that of Larson.

This was Paul Walker's final film appearance following his death on November 30, 2013.  Plans for a seventh installment were first announced in February 2012 when Johnson stated that production on the film would begin after the completion of Fast & Furious 6. In April 2013, Wan, predominantly known for horror films, was announced to direct the film. Casting began showing the returns of Diesel and Walker that same month. Principal photography began that September in Atlanta, but was indefinitely suspended in November after Walker's death; filming resumed in April 2014 and ended in July, with Walkers's brothers Caleb and Cody standing-in to complete his remaining scenes, causing delay to its 2015 release date; with other filming locations including Los Angeles, Colorado, Abu Dhabi, and Tokyo.

It stars Camille Keaton, Eron Tabor, Richard Pace, Anthony Nichols, and Gunter Kleemann. The film tells the story of Jennifer Hills, a fiction writer based in New York City who exacts revenge on each of her tormentors after four men gang rape and leave her for dead.  I Spit on Your Grave is noted for its very controversial depiction of extreme graphic violence, in particular the lengthy depictions of gang rape, that take up 30 minutes of the film's runtime. During its wider release, the film was branded a \\\"video nasty\\\" in the United Kingdom, and was a target of censorship by film commissioning bodies. As such, film critic Roger Ebert became one of the most notable detractors of the film, calling it \\\"a vile bag of garbage\\\". The film remains highly controversial to this day, even being considered to be one of the worst films ever made. For some, it is this controversy which has led to it being deemed a cult classic. Despite the controversy and negative reviews, the performance of Camille Keaton was praised by critics. It made Time magazine's Top 10 Ridiculously Violent Movies.  The film spawned a 2010 remake, which has since spawned two sequels of its own: I Spit on Your Grave 2 (2013), and I Spit on Your Grave III: Vengeance Is Mine (2015). A direct sequel, I Spit on Your Grave: Deja Vu , was released in 2019 with Zarchi and Keaton both returning.

In the film, the surviving members of the Avengers and their allies attempt to reverse the destruction caused by Thanos in Infinity War.  The film was announced in October 2014 as Avengers: Infinity War – Part 2 , but Marvel later removed this title. The Russo brothers joined as directors in April 2015, with Markus and McFeely signing on to write the script a month later. The film serves as a conclusion to the story of the MCU up to that point, ending the story arcs for several main characters. The plot revisits several moments from earlier films, bringing back actors and settings from throughout the franchise, as well as music from previous films. Filming began in August 2017 at Pinewood Atlanta Studios in Fayette County, Georgia, shooting back-to-back with Infinity War , and ended in January 2018. Additional filming took place in the Metro and Downtown Atlanta areas, New York state, Scotland, and England. The official title was revealed in December 2018. With an estimated budget of $356–400 million, the film is one of the most expensive films ever made.  Avengers: Endgame premiered in Los Angeles on April 22, 2019, and was released in the United States on April 26, as part of Phase Three of the MCU. The film received praise for its direction, acting, musical score, action sequences, visual effects, and emotional weight, with critics lauding its culmination of the 22-film story. The film grossed $2.798 billion worldwide, surpassing Infinity War 's entire theatrical run in just eleven days and breaking numerous box office records, including becoming the highest-grossing film of all time, which it held from July 2019 until March 2021.

Written and directed by Brad Bird, it is the sequel to The Incredibles (2004) and the second full-length installment of the franchise. The story follows the Incredibles as they try to restore the public's trust in superheroes while balancing their family life, only to combat a new foe who seeks to turn the populace against all superheroes. Craig T. Nelson, Holly Hunter, Sarah Vowell and Samuel L. Jackson reprise their roles from the first film; newcomers to the cast include Huckleberry Milner, Bob Odenkirk, Catherine Keener and Jonathan Banks. Michael Giacchino returned to compose the score.  Following the success of The Incredibles, Bird postponed development on a sequel to work on other films. He attempted to distinguish the script from superhero films and superhero television series released since the first film, focusing on the family dynamic rather than the superhero genre.  Incredibles 2 premiered in Los Angeles on June 5, 2018, and was theatrically released in the United States on June 15, 2018 in Disney Digital 3D, Dolby Cinema, Real D 3D, IMAX, IMAX 3D, and 4DX formats. The film received largely positive reviews from critics, with praise for its animation, humor, writing, and musical score. The film made $182.7 million in its opening weekend, setting the record for best debut for an animated film, and has grossed over $1.2 billion worldwide, making it the fourth-highest-grossing film of 2018, the second-highest-grossing animated film, and the 15th-highest-grossing film of all time during its theatrical run, along with being the highest-grossing Pixar film and the third to gross $1 billion after Finding Dory and Toy Story 3. Incredibles 2 was named by the National Board of Review as the Best Animated Film of 2018.

It stars Marilyn Monroe, Tony Curtis, Jack Lemmon, and features George Raft, Pat O'Brien, Joe E. Brown, Joan Shawlee, Grace Lee Whitney, and Nehemiah Persoff in supporting roles. The screenplay by Wilder and I. A. L. Diamond is based on a screenplay by Robert Thoeren and Michael Logan from the 1935 French film Fanfare of Love. The film is about two musicians who dress in drag in order to escape from mafia gangsters whom they witnessed committing a crime (inspired by the Saint Valentine's Day Massacre).   Some Like It Hot opened to critical and commercial success and is considered to be one of the greatest films of all time. The film received six Academy Award nominations, including Best Actor, Best Director and Best Adapted Screenplay, winning for Best Costume Design. In 1989, the Library of Congress selected it as one of the first 25 films for preservation in the United States National Film Registry for being \\\"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\\\". It was voted as the top comedy film by the American Film Institute on their list on AFI's 100 Years...100 Laughs poll in 2000, and was selected as the best comedy of all time in a poll of 253 film critics from 52 countries conducted by the BBC in 2017. In 2005, the British Film Institute included this film on its list of \\\"Top fifty films for children up to the age of 14\\\". In the 2012 Sight & Sound polls, it was ranked the 42nd-greatest film ever made in the critics' poll and 37th in the directors' poll. In the earlier 2002 Sight & Sound polls the film ranked 37th among critics and 24th among directors. In 2010, The Guardian considered it the 3rd-best comedy film of all time. In 2015, the film ranked 30th on BBC's \\\"100 Greatest American Films\\\" list, voted on by film critics from around the world.  The film was produced without approval from the Motion Picture Production Code (Hays Code) because it plays with the idea of homosexuality and features cross-dressing. The code had been gradually weakening in its scope since the early 1950s, due to greater social tolerance for previously taboo topics in film, but it was still officially enforced until the mid-1960s. The overwhelming success of Some Like It Hot is considered one of the final nails in the coffin for the Hays Code.\",\"CREW\":[{\"job\":\"producer\",\"names\":[\"Billy Wilder\"]},{\"job\":\"director\",\"names\":[\"Billy Wilder\"]},{\"job\":\"screenwriter\",\"names\":[\"I.

It is inspired by the life story of Spartacus, the leader of a slave revolt in antiquity, and the events of the Third Servile War. It stars Kirk Douglas in the title role, Laurence Olivier as Roman general and politician Marcus Licinius Crassus, Peter Ustinov as slave trader Lentulus Batiatus, John Gavin as Julius Caesar, Jean Simmons as Varinia, Charles Laughton as Sempronius Gracchus, and Tony Curtis as Antoninus.  Douglas, whose company Bryna Productions was producing the film, removed original director Anthony Mann after the first week of shooting. Kubrick, with whom Douglas had worked before, was brought on board to take over direction. It was the only film directed by Kubrick where he did not have complete artistic control. Screenwriter Dalton Trumbo was blacklisted at the time as one of the Hollywood Ten. Douglas publicly announced that Trumbo was the screenwriter of Spartacus , and President John F. Kennedy crossed American Legion picket lines to view the film, helping to end blacklisting; Howard Fast's book had also been blacklisted and he had to self-publish the original edition.  The film won four Academy Awards (Best Supporting Actor for Ustinov, Best Cinematography, Best Art Direction and Best Costume Design), and became the biggest moneymaker in Universal Studios' history, until it was surpassed by Airport (1970).

It was directed by Sam Raimi from a screenplay by Raimi, his older brother Ivan and Alvin Sargent. It is the final installment in Raimi's Spider-Man trilogy. The film stars Tobey Maguire as Peter Parker / Spider-Man, alongside Kirsten Dunst, James Franco, Thomas Haden Church, Topher Grace, Bryce Dallas Howard, James Cromwell, Rosemary Harris, and J. K. Simmons. The film also marks the final film appearance of Cliff Robertson before his retirement and death in 2011. Set a year after the events of Spider-Man 2 , the film follows Peter Parker as he prepares for his future with Mary Jane Watson, while facing three new villains: Uncle Ben's true killer, Flint Marko, who becomes Sandman after a freak accident; Harry Osborn, his former friend, who is now aware of Peter's identity and seeks to avenge his father; and Eddie Brock, a rival photographer who becomes Venom. Peter also faces his greatest challenge when he bonds with an extraterrestrial symbiote that increases his abilities but brings out his anger and other negative traits.  Development of Spider-Man 3 began immediately after the successful release of Spider-Man 2 for a 2007 release. During pre-production, Raimi originally wanted another villain to be included along with Sandman. At the request of producer Avi Arad, he added Venom and the producers also requested the addition of Gwen Stacy. Principal photography for the film began in January 2006, and took place in Los Angeles and Cleveland before moving to New York City from May until July 2006. Additional pick-up shots were made after August and the film wrapped in October 2006. During post-production, Sony Pictures Imageworks created over 900 visual effects shots. With an estimated production budget of $258–350 million, it was the most expensive film ever made at the time of its release.  Spider-Man 3 premiered on April 16, 2007, in Tokyo, and was released in the United States in both conventional and IMAX theaters on May 4, 2007. The film grossed $890.9 million worldwide, making it the highest-grossing film of the trilogy, the third-highest-grossing film of 2007 and was the highest-grossing Spider-Man film until it was surpassed by Spider-Man: Far From Home in 2019. Unlike the previous installments, Spider-Man 3 received mixed reviews from critics, who praised the action sequences and visual effects but criticized the plot and pacing and the use of too many villains. The perceived overcrowded narrative was later attributed to studio interferences and creative differences between Sony, Raimi, and Arad.  A fourth installment, titled Spider-Man 4 , was set to be released on May 6, 2011, followed by a Venom spin-off film, but both were canceled due to Raimi's withdrawal over creative differences with the writers and producers. The Spider-Man film series was rebooted twice; first with The Amazing Spider-Man (2012) by Marc Webb and starring Andrew Garfield; and later a new film series set within the Marvel Cinematic Universe, directed by Jon Watts and starring Tom Holland, beginning with Spider-Man: Homecoming (2017). The Venom spin-off was revived in 2016 by Sony and was finally released in 2018 with Venom and its sequel to be released in 2021, set within Sony Pictures Universe of Marvel Characters starring Tom Hardy.\",\"CREW\":[{\"job\":\"producer\",\"names\":[\"Avi Arad\",\"Laura Ziskin\",\"Grant Curtis\"]},{\"job\":\"executive producer\",\"names\":[\"Stan Lee\"]},{\"job\":\"director\",\"names\":[\"Sam Raimi\"]},{\"job\":\"screenwriter\",\"names\":[\"Ivan Raimi\",\"Alvin Sargent\",\"Sam Raimi\"]}],\"CAST\":[\"Thomas Haden Church\",\"Topher Grace\",\"Bryce Dallas Howard\",\"James Cromwell\",\"Rosemary Harris\",\"J.

The film was co-produced and released by DreamWorks Pictures and Universal Pictures. DreamWorks Pictures distributed the film in North America while Universal Pictures released it internationally through United International Pictures. It stars Russell Crowe, Joaquin Phoenix, Connie Nielsen, Ralf Möller, Oliver Reed (in his final role), Djimon Hounsou, Derek Jacobi, John Shrapnel, Richard Harris, and Tommy Flanagan. Crowe portrays Roman general Maximus Decimus Meridius, who is betrayed when Commodus, the ambitious son of Emperor Marcus Aurelius, murders his father and seizes the throne. Reduced to slavery, Maximus becomes a gladiator and rises through the ranks of the arena to avenge the murders of his family and his emperor.  Inspired by Daniel P. Mannix's 1958 book Those About to Die (formerly titled The Way of the Gladiator ), the film's script, initially written by Franzoni, was acquired by DreamWorks and Ridley Scott signed on to direct the film. Principal photography began in January 1999, before the script was completed, and wrapped up in May of that year, with the scenes of Ancient Rome shot over a period of nineteen weeks in Fort Ricasoli, Malta. The film's computer-generated imagery effects were created by British post-production company The Mill, who also created a digital body double for the remaining scenes involving Reed's character Proximo due to Reed dying of a heart attack during production.  Gladiator premiered in Los Angeles on May 1, 2000, and was released theatrically in the United States on May 5 and in the United Kingdom on May 11. The film received generally positive reviews from critics, with praise for the acting (particularly Crowe's and Phoenix's performances), Scott's direction, visuals, screenplay, action sequences, musical score and the production values. It was a box office success, grossing $187.7 million in the United States and grossed $457 million worldwide, making it the second highest-grossing film of 2000. The film won multiple awards, including five at the 73rd Academy Awards: Best Picture, Best Actor for Crowe, Best Costume Design, Best Sound and Best Visual Effects. It also received four BAFTA Awards at the 54th British Academy Film Awards for Best Film, Best Cinematography, Best Production Design and Best Editing. Since its release, Gladiator has also been credited with reinventing the swords and sandals genre and rekindling interest in entertainment centered around ancient Greek and ancient Roman culture such as the television series Rome.\",\"CREW\":[{\"job\":\"producer\",\"names\":[\"Douglas Wick\",\"David Franzoni\",\"Branko Lustig\",\"Terry Needham\"]},{\"job\":\"executive producer\",\"names\":[\"Laurie MacDonald\",\"Walter F.

The film depicts two days in the lives of four real estate salesmen and how desperate they become when the corporate office sends a trainer to \\\"motivate\\\" them. He tells them that, in a week's time, all except the top two salesmen will be fired.  The setting of the film is never explicitly stated. While the play is set in Chicago, Illinois, the film includes numerous references to New York City, including an establishing shot of a New York City Subway platform followed by a close-up shot of a New York Telephone-branded payphone, NYPD police cars and insignia, New York license plates, most characters using New York accents, etc. Film critics and journalists have nonetheless cited Chicago as the setting of the film, possibly based on their familiarity with the original play. Exterior shots were filmed on location in Sheepshead Bay, Brooklyn.  Like the play, the film is notorious for its use of profanity, leading the cast to refer to the film jokingly as \\\"Death of a Fuckin' Salesman\\\". The title of the film comes from the names of two of the real estate developments being peddled by the salesmen characters: Glengarry Highlands and Glen Ross Farms.  The world premiere of the film was held at the 49th Venice Film Festival, where Jack Lemmon was awarded the Volpi Cup for Best Actor. Al Pacino was nominated for an Academy Award and a Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor. Though the film was a box office failure, grossing $10.7 million in North America against a $12.5 million budget, Glengarry Glen Ross was acclaimed by critics and is now considered a cult classic.\",\"CREW\":[{\"job\":\"executive producer\",\"names\":[\"Joseph M.

The screenplay, written by Ol Parker, is based on the 2004 novel These Foolish Things by novelist Deborah Moggach, and features an ensemble cast consisting of Judi Dench, Celia Imrie, Bill Nighy, Ronald Pickup, Maggie Smith, Tom Wilkinson and Penelope Wilton, as a group of British pensioners moving to a retirement hotel in India, run by the young and eager Sonny, played by Dev Patel. The film was produced by Participant Media and Blueprint Pictures on a budget of $10 million.  Producers Graham Broadbent and Peter Czernin first saw the potential for a film in Deborah Moggach's novel with the idea of exploring the lives of the elderly beyond what one would expect of their age group. With the assistance of screenwriter Ol Parker, they came up with a script in which they take the older characters completely out of their element and involve them in a romantic comedy.  Principal photography began on 10 October 2010 in India, and most of the filming took place in the Indian state of Rajasthan, including the cities of Jaipur and Udaipur. Ravla Khempur, an equestrian hotel which was originally the palace of a tribal chieftain in the village of Khempur, was chosen as the site for the film hotel.  The film was released in the United Kingdom on 24 February 2012 and received positive reception from critics; The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel opened to strong box-office earnings in the United Kingdom, and topped the box office after its second weekend on release. It became a surprise box-office hit following its international release, eventually grossing nearly $137 million worldwide.

Produced by Marvel Studios and distributed by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures, it is the direct sequel to Avengers: Infinity War (2018) and the 22nd film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). Directed by Anthony and Joe Russo and written by Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely, the film features an ensemble cast including Robert Downey Jr., Chris Evans, Mark Ruffalo, Chris Hemsworth, Scarlett Johansson, Jeremy Renner, Don Cheadle, Paul Rudd, Brie Larson, Karen Gillan, Danai Gurira, Benedict Wong, Jon Favreau, Bradley Cooper, Gwyneth Paltrow, and Josh Brolin. In the film, the surviving members of the Avengers and their allies attempt to reverse the destruction caused by Thanos in Infinity War.  The film was announced in October 2014 as Avengers: Infinity War – Part 2 , but Marvel later removed this title. The Russo brothers joined as directors in April 2015, with Markus and McFeely signing on to write the script a month later. The film serves as a conclusion to the story of the MCU up to that point, ending the story arcs for several main characters. The plot revisits several moments from earlier films, bringing back actors and settings from throughout the franchise, as well as music from previous films. Filming began in August 2017 at Pinewood Atlanta Studios in Fayette County, Georgia, shooting back-to-back with Infinity War , and ended in January 2018. Additional filming took place in the Metro and Downtown Atlanta areas, New York state, Scotland, and England. The official title was revealed in December 2018. With an estimated budget of $356–400 million, the film is one of the most expensive films ever made.  Avengers: Endgame premiered in Los Angeles on April 22, 2019, and was released in the United States on April 26, as part of Phase Three of the MCU. The film received praise for its direction, acting, musical score, action sequences, visual effects, and emotional weight, with critics lauding its culmination of the 22-film story. The film grossed $2.798 billion worldwide, surpassing Infinity War 's entire theatrical run in just eleven days and breaking numerous box office records, including becoming the highest-grossing film of all time, which it held from July 2019 until March 2021. The film received numerous awards and nominations, including a nomination for Best Visual Effects at the 92nd Academy Awards, three nominations at the 25th Critics' Choice Awards (winning two), and a nomination for Special Visual Effects at the 73rd British Academy Film Awards.\",\"CREW\":[{\"job\":\"producer\",\"names\":[\"Kevin Feige\"]},{\"job\":\"executive producer\",\"names\":[\"Jon Favreau\",\"Louis D'Esposito\",\"Victoria Alonso\",\"Michael Grillo\",\"Trinh Tran\",\"James Gunn\",\"Stan Lee\"]},{\"job\":\"director\",\"names\":[\"Russo brothers\"]},{\"job\":\"screenwriter\",\"names\":[\"Christopher Markus\",\"Stephen McFeely\",\"Jack Kirby\",\"Stan Lee\"]}],\"CAST\":[\"Chris Hemsworth\",\"Mark Ruffalo\",\"Chris Evans\",\"Josh Brolin\",\"Tom Hiddleston\",\"Robert Downey Jr.\",\"Samuel L.

Starring John Travolta, Samuel L. Jackson, Bruce Willis, Tim Roth, Ving Rhames, and Uma Thurman, it tells several stories of criminal Los Angeles. The title refers to the pulp magazines and hardboiled crime novels popular during the mid-20th century, known for their graphic violence and punchy dialogue.  Tarantino wrote Pulp Fiction in 1992 and 1993, incorporating scenes that Avary originally wrote for True Romance (1993). Its plot occurs out of chronological order. The film is also self-referential from its opening moments, beginning with a title card that gives two dictionary definitions of \\\"pulp\\\". Considerable screen time is devoted to monologues and casual conversations with eclectic dialogue revealing each character's perspectives on several subjects, and the film features an ironic combination of humor and strong violence. TriStar Pictures reportedly turned down the script as \\\"too demented\\\". Then Miramax co-chairman Harvey Weinstein was enthralled, however, and the film became the first that Miramax fully financed.  Pulp Fiction won the Palme d'Or at the 1994 Cannes Film Festival, and was a major critical and commercial success. It was nominated for seven awards at the 67th Academy Awards, including Best Picture, and won Best Original Screenplay; it earned Travolta, Jackson, and Thurman Academy Award nominations and boosted their careers. Its development, marketing, distribution, and profitability had a sweeping effect on independent cinema.  Pulp Fiction is widely regarded as Tarantino's masterpiece, with particular praise for its screenwriting. The self-reflexivity, unconventional structure, and extensive homage and pastiche have led critics to describe it as a touchstone of postmodern film. It is often considered a cultural watershed, influencing films and other media that adopted elements of its style. The cast was also widely praised, with Travolta, Thurman and Jackson earning particular acclaim. In 2008, Entertainment Weekly named it the best film since 1983 and it has appeared on many critics' lists of the greatest films ever made. In 2013, Pulp Fiction was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as \\\"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\\\".\",\"CREW\":[{\"job\":\"producer\",\"names\":[\"Lawrence Bender\"]},{\"job\":\"executive producer\",\"names\":[\"Michael Shamberg\",\"Stacey Sher\",\"Danny DeVito\"]},{\"job\":\"director\",\"names\":[\"Quentin Tarantino\"]},{\"job\":\"screenwriter\",\"names\":[\"Quentin Tarantino\",\"Roger Avary\"]}],\"CAST\":[\"Bruce Willis\",\"John Travolta\",\"Rosanna Arquette\",\"Uma Thurman\",\"Samuel L.

Incorporating both historical and fictionalized aspects, it is based on accounts of the sinking of the RMS Titanic , and stars Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet as members of different social classes who fall in love aboard the ship during its ill- fated maiden voyage.  Cameron's inspiration for the film came from his fascination with shipwrecks; he felt a love story interspersed with the human loss would be essential to convey the emotional impact of the disaster. Production began in 1995, when Cameron shot footage of the actual Titanic wreck. The modern scenes on the research vessel  were shot on board the Akademik Mstislav Keldysh , which Cameron had used as a base when filming the wreck. Scale models, computer- generated imagery, and a reconstruction of the Titanic built at Baja Studios were used to re-create the sinking. The film was co-financed by Paramount Pictures and 20th Century Fox; the former handled distribution in North America while the latter released the film internationally. It was the most expensive film ever made at the time, with a production budget of $200 million.  Upon its release on December 19, 1997, Titanic achieved significant critical and commercial success, and later received numerous accolades. Nominated for 14 Academy Awards, it tied All About Eve (1950) for the most Oscar nominations, and won 11, including the awards for Best Picture and Best Director, tying Ben-Hur (1959) for the most Oscars won by a single film. With an initial worldwide gross of over $1.84 billion, Titanic was the first film to reach the billion-dollar mark. It remained the highest-grossing film of all time until Cameron's Avatar surpassed it in 2010. A 3D version of Titanic, released on April 4, 2012, to commemorate the centennial of the sinking, earned it an additional $343.6 million worldwide, pushing the film's worldwide total to $2.195 billion and making it the second film to gross more than $2 billion worldwide (after Avatar ).

The film stars the voices of Donald Glover, Seth Rogen, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Alfre Woodard, Billy Eichner, John Kani, John Oliver, Florence Kasumba, Eric André, Keegan-Michael Key, JD McCrary, Shahadi Wright Joseph, and Beyoncé Knowles-Carter, as well as James Earl Jones reprising his role from the original film. The plot follows Simba, a young lion who must embrace his role as the rightful king of his native land following the murder of his father, Mufasa, at the hands of his uncle, Scar.  Plans for a remake of 1994's The Lion King were confirmed in September 2016 following box office successes for Disney remakes such as The Jungle Book (2016), which was also directed by Favreau. Favreau was inspired by certain roles of characters in the Broadway adaptation, and developed upon elements of the original film's story. Much of the main cast signed in early 2017, and principal photography began in mid-2017 on a blue screen stage in Los Angeles. The \\\"virtual-reality tools\\\" utilized in The Jungle Book 's cinematography were used to a greater degree during filming of The Lion King. Composers Hans Zimmer, Elton John, and lyricist Tim Rice, all of whom worked on the original's soundtrack, returned to compose the score alongside Knowles-Carter, who assisted John in the reworking of the soundtrack and wrote a new song for the film, titled \\\"Spirit\\\", which she also performed. The film serves as the final credit for editor Mark Livolsi, and it is dedicated to his memory. With an estimated budget of around $260 million, it is one of the most expensive films ever made.  The film was theatrically released in the United States on July 19, 2019. It has grossed over $1.6 billion worldwide during its theatrical run, overtaking Frozen to become the highest-grossing animated film of all time. It also became the seventh highest-grossing film of all time and the second highest- grossing film of 2019. The Lion King received mixed reviews from critics, with praise for its visual effects, music, and vocal performances (particularly Rogen and Eichner), but criticism for its excessive similarity to the original film, and lack of originality and facial emotion on the characters. The film received nominations for Best Animated Feature Film and Original Song categories at the 77th Golden Globe Awards and 25th Critics' Choice Awards. It was also nominated at 73rd British Academy Film Awards and 92nd Academy Awards, both for visual effects. A follow-up film is in development with Barry Jenkins attached to direct.\",\"CREW\":[{\"job\":\"producer\",\"names\":[\"Jon Favreau\"]},{\"job\":\"director\",\"names\":[\"Jon

It was directed by Tony Bancroft and Barry Cook, with story by Robert D. San Souci and screenplay by Rita Hsiao, Philip LaZebnik, Chris Sanders, Eugenia Bostwick-Singer, and Raymond Singer. Ming-Na Wen, Eddie Murphy, Miguel Ferrer and BD Wong star in the English version, while Jackie Chan provided the voice of Captain Li Shang for the Chinese dubs of the film. The film's plot takes place in China during the Han dynasty, where Fa Mulan, daughter of aged warrior Fa Zhou, impersonates a man to take her father's place during a general conscription to counter a Hun invasion.  Produced and released during the Disney Renaissance, Mulan was the first of three features produced primarily at the Disney animation studio at Disney-MGM Studios (now Disney's Hollywood Studios) in Bay Lake, Florida. Development for the film began in 1994, when a number of artistic supervisors were sent to China to receive artistic and cultural inspiration. Mulan was well received by critics and the public who praised the animation, plot, characters (particularly the eponymous character), and musical score, and grossed over $304 million. It earned a Golden Globe and Academy Award nomination and won several Annie Awards, including Best Animated Feature. It was then followed by Mulan II in 2004, a direct-to-video sequel.

It stars Jeff Bridges as Jeffrey \\\"The Dude\\\" Lebowski, a Los Angeles slacker and avid bowler. He is assaulted as a result of mistaken identity, then learns that a millionaire also named Jeffrey Lebowski was the intended victim. The millionaire Lebowski's trophy wife is kidnapped, and he commissions The Dude to deliver the ransom to secure her release; the plan goes awry when the Dude's friend Walter Sobchak (John Goodman) schemes to keep the ransom money. Sam Elliott, Julianne Moore, Steve Buscemi, David Huddleston, John Turturro, Philip Seymour Hoffman, Tara Reid, David Thewlis, Peter Stormare, and Ben Gazzara also appear, in supporting roles.  The film is loosely inspired by the work of Raymond Chandler. Joel Coen stated, \\\"We wanted to do a Chandler kind of story – how it moves episodically, and deals with the characters trying to unravel a mystery, as well as having a hopelessly complex plot that's ultimately unimportant.\\\" The original score was composed by Carter Burwell, a longtime collaborator of the Coen brothers.  The Big Lebowski received mixed reviews at the time of its release. Over time, reviews have become largely positive, and the film has become a cult favorite, noted for its eccentric characters, comedic dream sequences, idiosyncratic dialogue, and eclectic soundtrack.

Goyer, and features an ensemble cast that includes Ben Affleck, Henry Cavill, Amy Adams, Jesse Eisenberg, Diane Lane, Laurence Fishburne, Jeremy Irons, Holly Hunter, and Gal Gadot. Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice is the first live-action film to feature Batman and Superman together, as well as the first live-action cinematic portrayal of Wonder Woman. In the film, criminal mastermind Lex Luthor manipulates Batman into a preemptive battle with Superman, with whom Luthor is obsessed.  The film was announced at the 2013 San Diego Comic-Con after the release of Man of Steel. Snyder stated that the film would take inspiration from the Batman comic book series The Dark Knight Returns by Frank Miller but clarified that it would follow an original premise. The incarnation of Batman in the film is different from the character's previous portrayal in The Dark Knight Trilogy , serving as a cinematic reboot of the character. The film is also inspired by narrative elements from the \\\"Death of Superman\\\". Pre- production began at East Los Angeles College in October 2013, with principal photography starting in May 2014 in Detroit. Additional filming also took place in Illinois and New Mexico, concluding that December.  Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice premiered at the Auditorio Nacional in Mexico City on March 19, 2016, and was released in the United States on March 25, 2016, in 2D, 3D, premium large formats, and 70 mm prints by Warner Bros. Pictures. Following a strong debut that set new box office records, the film experienced a historic drop in its second weekend and never recovered. Despite turning a profit, it was deemed a box office disappointment and received generally unfavorable reviews from critics for its tone, screenplay, and pacing, though some praised its visual style and acting performances. An extended cut dubbed the \\\"Ultimate Edition\\\", which features 31 minutes of additional footage, was released digitally on June 28, 2016, and on Blu-ray on July 19, 2016.

Based on a story by O'Bannon and Ronald Shusett, it follows the crew of the commercial space tug Nostromo , who encounter the eponymous Alien, an aggressive and deadly extraterrestrial set loose on the ship. The film stars Tom Skerritt, Sigourney Weaver, Veronica Cartwright, Harry Dean Stanton, John Hurt, Ian Holm, and Yaphet Kotto. It was produced by Gordon Carroll, David Giler, and Walter Hill through their company Brandywine Productions, and was distributed by 20th Century Fox. Giler and Hill revised and made additions to the script; Shusett was executive producer. The Alien and its accompanying artifacts were designed by the Swiss artist H. R. Giger, while concept artists Ron Cobb and Chris Foss designed the more human settings.  Alien premiered May 25, 1979, as the opening night of the fourth Seattle International Film Festival, presented in 70mm at midnight. It received a wide release on June 22 and was released September 6 in the United Kingdom. It was met with critical acclaim and box-office success, winning the Academy Award for Best Visual Effects, three Saturn Awards (Best Science Fiction Film, Best Direction for Scott, and Best Supporting Actress for Cartwright), and a Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation, along with numerous other nominations. It has been consistently praised in the years since its release, and is considered one of the greatest films of all time. In 2002, Alien was deemed \\\"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\\\" by the Library of Congress and was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry. In 2008, it was ranked by the American Film Institute as the seventh-best film in the science-fiction genre, and as the 33rd-greatest film of all time by Empire.  The success of Alien spawned a media franchise of films, novels, comic books, video games, and toys. It also launched Weaver's acting career, providing her with her first lead role. The story of her character's encounters with the Alien creatures became the thematic and narrative core of the sequels Aliens (1986), Alien 3 (1992), and Alien Resurrection (1997). A crossover with the Predator franchise produced the Alien vs. Predator films: Alien vs. Predator (2004) and Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem (2007).

Directed by Colin Trevorrow, written by Rick Jaffa and Amanda Silver, alongside Derek Connolly and Trevorrow from a story by Jaffa and Silver, and produced by Frank Marshall and Patrick Crowley, the film stars Chris Pratt, Bryce Dallas Howard, Vincent D'Onofrio, Ty Simpkins, Nick Robinson, Omar Sy, BD Wong, and Irrfan Khan. Set 22 years after the events of Jurassic Park , Jurassic World takes place on the same fictional island of Isla Nublar, located off the Pacific coast of Costa Rica. A successful theme park of cloned dinosaurs, dubbed Jurassic World, has operated on the island for years, bringing John Hammond's dream to fruition. The park plunges into chaos when a transgenic dinosaur escapes from its enclosure and goes on a rampage, while a conspiracy orchestrated by the park's staff creates more dangers.  Universal Pictures intended to begin production of a fourth Jurassic Park film in 2004 for a mid-2005 release but was in development hell while the script underwent several revisions. Following a suggestion from executive producer Steven Spielberg, writers Jaffa and Silver explored the idea of a functional dinosaur park. Once Trevorrow was hired as director in 2013, he followed the same idea while developing a new script with Connolly. Filming lasted from April to August 2014 in Louisiana and Hawaii. The dinosaurs were created by Industrial Light & Magic using CGI and by Legacy Effects using life-sized animatronics. Production was completed in May 2015.   Jurassic World was released in the United States on June 12, 2015. The film received generally positive reviews from critics and grossed $1.6 billion in box office revenue, reaching third among the highest-grossing films of all time. It was also the second-highest-grossing film of 2015 and the highest- grossing in the franchise. The sequel, Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom , was released in June 2018.

The Ring has found its way to the young hobbit Frodo Baggins. The fate of Middle- earth hangs in the balance as Frodo and eight companions (who form the Fellowship of the Ring) begin their journey to Mount Doom in the land of Mordor, the only place where the Ring can be destroyed.  The Fellowship of the Ring was financed and distributed by American studio New Line Cinema, but filmed and edited entirely in Jackson's native New Zealand, concurrently with the other two parts of the trilogy.

After the release of Iron Man 2 in May 2010, director Favreau chose not to return for a third film. Black was hired to write and direct the sequel in February 2011, working with Pearce to make the script more character-centric, focus on thriller elements, and use concepts from Warren Ellis's \\\"Extremis\\\" comic book story arc. The film's supporting cast, including Kingsley, Pearce, and Hall, were brought on throughout April and May 2012. Filming took place from May 23 to December 17, 2012, primarily at EUE/Screen Gems Studios in Wilmington, North Carolina. Additional filming took place around North Carolina as well as in Florida, Los Angeles, and China; an extended version of the film specifically for Chinese audiences was created.

The film was officially announced at the 2014 San Diego Comic-Con International before the theatrical release of the first film, along with James Gunn's return from the first film, with the title of the sequel revealed a year later in June 2015. Principal photography began in February 2016 at Pinewood Atlanta Studios in Fayette County, Georgia, with many crew changes from the first film due to other commitments.

James Gunn chose to set the sequel shortly after the first film to explore the characters' new roles as the Guardians, and to follow the storyline of Quill's father established throughout that previous film. Russell was confirmed as Quill's father in July 2016, portraying Ego, a departure from Quill's comic father.

The film centers on an elderly widower named Carl Fredricksen (Ed Asner) and an earnest boy named Russell (Jordan Nagai); by tying thousands of balloons to his house, Carl sets out to fulfill his dream to see the wilds of South America and complete a promise made to his late wife, Ellie. The film was directed by Pete Docter and co-directed by Bob Peterson, who also wrote the film's screenplay with Docter, as well as the story with Tom McCarthy. The music was composed by Michael Giacchino, who had also composed music for The Incredibles and Ratatouille.  Docter began working on the story in 2004 called Heliums , which was based on fantasies of escaping from life when it becomes too irritating. He and eleven other Pixar artists spent three days in Venezuela gathering research and inspiration. The designs of the characters were caricatured and stylized considerably, and animators were challenged with creating realistic cloth. It was Pixar's first film to be presented in Disney Digital 3-D.   Up was released on May 29, 2009, and opened the 2009 Cannes Film Festival, becoming the first animated and 3-D film to do so. The film grossed over $735 million, becoming the sixth highest-grossing film of 2009. The film received widespread acclaim from critics and audiences, with many calling it one of the best animated films of all time. The characters, themes, narrative, Asner's vocal performance and Giacchino's score were praised, as was the montage of Carl and his wife Ellie growing old together.

It stars an ensemble cast, including Hugh Jackman, James McAvoy, Michael Fassbender, Jennifer Lawrence, Halle Berry, Anna Paquin, Elliot Page, Peter Dinklage, Ian McKellen, and Patrick Stewart. The story, inspired by the 1981 Uncanny X-Men storyline \\\"Days of Future Past\\\" by Chris Claremont and John Byrne, focuses on two time periods, with Logan traveling back in time to 1973 to change history and prevent an event that results in doom for both humans and mutants.  Vaughn had directed X-Men: First Class and was set to return in Days of Future Past before leaving for Kingsman: The Secret Service and the 2015 version of Fantastic Four. Thus Singer, who had directed the first two X- Men films, made his return as a director, and brought along most of the crew from those productions.

It is the first installment in The Hunger Games film series and was produced by Nina Jacobson and Jon Kilik, with a screenplay by Ross, Collins, and Billy Ray. The film stars Jennifer Lawrence, Josh Hutcherson, Liam Hemsworth, Woody Harrelson, Elizabeth Banks, Lenny Kravitz, Stanley Tucci, and Donald Sutherland. The film is set in a dystopian post-apocalyptic future in the nation of Panem, where a boy and a girl from each of the nation's 12 Districts are chosen annually as \\\"tributes\\\" and forced to compete in The Hunger Games, an elaborate televised fight to the death. Katniss Everdeen (Lawrence) volunteers to take her younger sister's place when her sister was initially selected as tribute. With her district's male tribute, Peeta Mellark (Hutcherson), Katniss travels to the Capitol to train and compete in the games.  Development of The Hunger Games began in March 2009 when Lions Gate Entertainment entered into a co-production agreement with Color Force, which had acquired the rights a few weeks earlier. Collins collaborated with Ray and Ross to write the screenplay. The screenplay expanded the character of Seneca Crane to allow several developments to be shown directly to the audience and Ross added several scenes between Crane and Coriolanus Snow. The main characters were cast between March and May 2011. Principal photography began in May 2011 and ended that September, with filming taking place in North Carolina.  The film was released on March 21, 2012 in some European countries, and in the US and UK on March 23, 2012, in both conventional theaters and digital IMAX theaters. When the film was released, it set records for opening day ($67.3 million) and opening weekend for a non-sequel. At the time of its release, the film's opening weekend gross ($152.5 million) was the third-largest of any film in North America. It is the first film since Avatar to remain in first place at the North American box office for four consecutive weekends. The film was a massive box-office success by grossing over $694 million worldwide against its budget of $78 million, making it the third-highest-grossing film in the United States and ninth-highest-grossing film of 2012. It was released on DVD and Blu-ray on August 18, 2012. The second installment, The Hunger Games: Catching Fire , was released on November 22, 2013, in the United States.  The Hunger Games received positive reviews from critics, with praise for its themes and messages, as well as Lawrence's portrayal of Katniss; some criticism was leveled at the film's reliance on shaky cam, especially in the action sequences, and its similarities to other works. The film's soundtrack featured the song \\\"Safe & Sound\\\", which was sung by American singer Taylor Swift featuring The Civil Wars; it won a Grammy Award and was nominated for a Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song. For her performance, Lawrence won the Saturn Award for Best Actress, the Broadcast Film Critics Association Award for Best Actress in an Action Movie, the Empire Award for Best Actress and was also nominated for the New York Film Critics Circle Award for Best Actress.\",\"s\":false},{\"n\":\"vertex_prop_boolean_8\",\"v\":\"false\",\"s\":false},{\"n\":\"NOMINATIONS\",\"v\":\"\",\"s\":false},{\"n\":\"MAIN_SUBJECT\",\"v\":\"social control\",\"s\":false},{\"n\":\"TITLE\",\"v\":\"The Hunger Games\",\"s\":true},{\"n\":\"BUDGET\",\"v\":\"7.8E7\",\"s\":false},{\"n\":\"CAST\",\"v\":\"[\\\"Josh Hutcherson\\\",\\\"Liam Hemsworth\\\",\\\"Woody Harrelson\\\",\\\"Lenny Kravitz\\\",\\\"Stanley Tucci\\\",\\\"Willow Shields\\\",\\\"Isabelle Fuhrman\\\",\\\"Amandla Stenberg\\\",\\\"Alexander Ludwig\\\",\\\"Toby Jones\\\",\\\"Wes Bentley\\\",\\\"Leven Rambin\\\",\\\"Dayo Okeniyi\\\",\\\"Jennifer Lawrence\\\",\\\"Jacqueline Emerson\\\",\\\"Jack Quaid\\\",\\\"Elizabeth Banks\\\",\\\"Donald Sutherland\\\",\\\"Kimiko Gelman\\\",\\\"Nelson Ascencio\\\",\\\"Paula Malcomson\\\",\\\"Kalia Prescott\\\",\\\"Annie Thurman\\\",\\\"Ian Nelson\\\"]\",\"s\":false},{\"n\":\"MOVIE_ID\",\"v\":\"3306\",\"s\":false},{\"n\":\"GENRES\",\"v\":\"[\\\"Sci-Fi\\\",\\\"Adventure\\\",\\\"Thriller\\\",\\\"Horror\\\",\\\"Fantasy\\\",\\\"Drama\\\",\\\"Action\\\"]\",\"s\":false},{\"n\":\"personalized_salsa\",\"v\":\"0.001997433360410588\",\"s\":true},{\"n\":\"RUNTIME\",\"v\":\"142.0\",\"s\":false},{\"n\":\"AWARDS\",\"v\":\"[\\\"Saturn Award for Best Actress\\\",\\\"Teen Choice Award for Best Villain\\\"]\",\"s\":false},{\"n\":\"LIST_PRICE\",\"v\":\"0.0\",\"s\":false},{\"n\":\"YEAR\",\"v\":\"2012.0\",\"s\":false},{\"n\":\"SKU\",\"v\":\"XOY6735\",\"s\":false},{\"n\":\"VIEWS\",\"v\":\"2733.0\",\"s\":false},{\"n\":\"OPENING_DATE\",\"v\":\"2012-04-20T00:00\",\"s\":false}],\"l\":[\"MOVIE\"],\"g\":[\"M\"]},{\"_id\":\"MOVIE(2629)\",\"p\":[{\"n\":\"CREW\",\"v\":\"[{\\\"job\\\":\\\"producer\\\",\\\"names\\\":[\\\"Cathy Konrad\\\",\\\"Cary Woods\\\",\\\"Stuart M.

The film stars David Arquette, Neve Campbell, Courteney Cox, Matthew Lillard, Rose McGowan, Skeet Ulrich, and Drew Barrymore. Released on December 20, it follows the character of Sidney Prescott (Campbell), a high school student in the fictional town of Woodsboro, California, who becomes the target of a mysterious killer in a Halloween costume known as Ghostface. The film combines black comedy and \\\"whodunit\\\" mystery with the violence of the slasher genre to satirize the clichés of the horror movie genre popularized in films such as Halloween (1978), Friday the 13th (1980) and Craven's own A Nightmare on Elm Street (1984). Scream was considered unique at the time of its release for featuring characters who were aware of real-world horror films and openly discussed the clichés that the film attempted to subvert.  Inspired by the real-life case of the Gainesville Ripper, Scream was influenced by Williamson's passion for horror films, especially Halloween (1978). The script, originally titled Scary Movie , was bought by Dimension Films and was retitled by the Weinstein Brothers just before filming was complete. The production faced censorship issues with the Motion Picture Association of America and obstacles from locals while filming on location. The film received positive reviews and was a financial success, earning $173 million worldwide, becoming the highest-grossing slasher film until the release of Halloween (2018). It still remains the highest-grossing slasher film in adjusted dollars. It received several awards and award nominations. The soundtrack by Marco Beltrami was also acclaimed, and was cited as \\\"[one] of the most intriguing horror scores composed in years\\\". The score has since earned \\\"cult status\\\". Scream marked a change in the genre as it cast already-established and successful actors, which was considered to have helped it find a wider audience, including a significant female viewership.  Scream was credited with revitalizing the horror genre in the 1990s, which was considered to be almost dead following an influx of direct-to-video titles and numerous sequels to established horror franchises of the 1970s and 1980s. These sequels drew decreasing financial and critical success, as they exploited clichés upon which films in the genre had become reliant. Scream 's success spawned a series of sequels, though only Scream 2 , released the following year, achieved an equal level of commercial and critical success. In the years following the release of Scream and its sequels, they were accused of inspiring and even inducing violent crimes and murders.\",\"s\":false},{\"n\":\"vertex_prop_boolean_8\",\"v\":\"false\",\"s\":false},{\"n\":\"NOMINATIONS\",\"v\":\"[\\\"Saturn Award for Best Director\\\",\\\"Saturn Award for Best Supporting Actor\\\",\\\"Saturn Award for Best Supporting Actress\\\",\\\"MTV Movie Award for Best Movie\\\",\\\"MTV Movie Award for Best Performance\\\"]\",\"s\":false},{\"n\":\"MAIN_SUBJECT\",\"v\":\"revenge\",\"s\":false},{\"n\":\"TITLE\",\"v\":\"Scream\",\"s\":true},{\"n\":\"BUDGET\",\"v\":\"15.0\",\"s\":false},{\"n\":\"CAST\",\"v\":\"[\\\"David Arquette\\\",\\\"Neve Campbell\\\",\\\"Courteney Cox\\\",\\\"Matthew Lillard\\\",\\\"Rose McGowan\\\",\\\"Skeet Ulrich\\\",\\\"Drew Barrymore\\\",\\\"Jamie Kennedy\\\",\\\"Joseph Whipp\\\",\\\"Liev Schreiber\\\",\\\"Frances Lee McCain\\\",\\\"Henry Winkler\\\",\\\"Wes Craven\\\",\\\"Roger L.

The film follows a young boy as he defends his home from two burglars after his family accidentally leaves him behind in Chicago on their vacation to Paris.  Hughes conceived the film while preparing to go on vacation. Warner Bros. originally intended to finance and distribute the film, but shut down production after it exceeded its assigned budget, and 20th Century Fox assumed responsibilities following secret meetings with Hughes. Columbus and Culkin were soon cast, and filming took place between February and May 1990 on location across Illinois.  Home Alone premiered in Chicago on November 10, 1990, and was theatrically released in the United States on November 16. Upon release, it became a financial success and received positive reviews, with praise for its cast, humor, and music. Home Alone grossed $476.7 million worldwide, becoming the highest-grossing live-action comedy until the release of The Hangover Part II (2011), and made Culkin a child star. It was nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture – Musical or Comedy, and Best Actor in a Motion Picture – Musical or Comedy for Culkin, and for the Academy Award for Best Original Score for John Williams, and Best Original Song for \\\"Somewhere in My Memory\\\".

It stars Harrison Ford, Karen Allen, Paul Freeman, Ronald Lacey, John Rhys-Davies, and Denholm Elliott. Ford portrays Indiana Jones, a globe-trotting archaeologist vying with Nazi German forces in 1936 to recover the long-lost Ark of the Covenant, a relic said to make an army invincible. Teaming up with his tough former lover Marion Ravenwood (Allen), Jones races to stop rival archaeologist Dr. René Belloq (Freeman) from guiding the Nazis to the Ark and its power.  Lucas conceived Raiders of the Lost Ark in the early 1970s. Seeking to modernize the serial films of the early 20th-century, he developed the idea further with Kaufman, who suggested the Ark as the film's goal. Lucas eventually focused on developing his 1977 space opera Star Wars. Development on Raiders of the Lost Ark resumed that year when he shared the idea with Spielberg, who joined the project several months later. While the pair had ideas for set pieces and stunts for the film, they hired Kasdan to fill in the narrative gaps between them. Principal photography began in June 1980 on a $20 million budget and concluded the following September. Filming took place on sets at Elstree Studios, England, and on location mainly in La Rochelle, France, Tunisia, and Hawaii.  Though prerelease polling showed little audience interest in the film, especially compared to the superhero film Superman II , Raiders of the Lost Ark became the highest-grossing film of 1981, earning approximately $330.5 million worldwide, and played in some theaters for over a year. It was a critical success, receiving praise for its modern take on the serial film, its non-stop action and adventure, and the cast, particularly Ford, Allen, and Freeman. The film was nominated for several awards and, among others, won five Academy Awards, seven Saturn Awards, and one BAFTA.  Raiders of the Lost Ark is now considered one of the greatest films ever made and has had a lasting impact on popular culture, spawning a host of imitators across several media, and inspired other filmmakers. The United States Library of Congress selected it for preservation in the National Film Registry in 1999. Raiders of the Lost Ark is the first entry in what would become the Indiana Jones franchise, which includes three more films— Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom (1984), Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade (1989), and Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull (2008)—a television series, video games, comic books, novels, theme park attractions, toys, and an amateur remake.

It is the sequel to Captain America: The First Avenger (2011) and the ninth film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). The film was directed by Anthony and Joe Russo from a screenplay by the writing team of Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely. It stars Chris Evans as Steve Rogers / Captain America alongside Scarlett Johansson, Sebastian Stan, Anthony Mackie, Cobie Smulders, Frank Grillo, Emily VanCamp, Hayley Atwell, Robert Redford, and Samuel L. Jackson. In the film, Captain America joins forces with Black Widow and Falcon to uncover a conspiracy within the spy agency S.H.I.E.L.D. while facing a mysterious assassin known as the Winter Soldier.  Markus and McFeely began writing the sequel around the release of The First Avenger in July 2011. The script draws from the Winter Soldier story arc in the comic books written by Ed Brubaker as well as conspiracy fiction from the 1970s such as Three Days of the Condor (1975). The film explores S.H.I.E.L.D., similarly to how the first film explored the U.S. military, after Rogers was shown working for the agency in the MCU crossover film The Avengers (2012). The Russo brothers signed to direct in June 2012 and casting began the following month. Filming began in April 2013 in Los Angeles, California, before moving to Washington, D.C., and Cleveland, Ohio. The directors used practical effects and intense stunt work, but also 2,500 visual effects shots created by six companies.  Captain America: The Winter Soldier premiered in Los Angeles on March 13, 2014, and was released in the United States on April 4, as part of Phase Two of the MCU. The film became a critical and commercial success, grossing over $714 million worldwide, making it the seventh-highest-grossing film of 2014, and received an Academy Award nomination for Best Visual Effects. A sequel titled Captain America: Civil War , also directed by the Russos, was released in 2016.\",\"s\":false},{\"n\":\"vertex_prop_boolean_8\",\"v\":\"false\",\"s\":false},{\"n\":\"NOMINATIONS\",\"v\":\"[\\\"Academy Award for Best Visual Effects\\\",\\\"Saturn Award for Best Comic-to-Film Motion Picture\\\",\\\"Saturn Award for Best Director\\\",\\\"Saturn Award for Best Writing\\\",\\\"Saturn Award for the Best Actor\\\",\\\"Saturn Award for Best Supporting Actor\\\",\\\"Saturn Award for Best Supporting Actor\\\",\\\"Saturn Award for Best Supporting Actress\\\",\\\"Saturn Award for Best Music\\\",\\\"Saturn Award for Best Editing\\\",\\\"Saturn Award for best production design\\\",\\\"Saturn Award for Best Special Effects\\\",\\\"MTV Movie Award for Best Fight\\\",\\\"MTV Movie Award for Best Kiss\\\",\\\"Critics' Choice Movie Award for Best Action Movie\\\",\\\"Critics' Choice Movie Award for Best Actor in an Action Movie\\\",\\\"Teen Choice Award for Choice Movie - Sci-Fi/Fantasy\\\",\\\"Teen Choice Award for Choice Movie Actor - Sci-Fi/Fantasy\\\",\\\"Teen Choice Award for Choice Movie Actress - Sci-Fi/Fantasy\\\",\\\"Teen Choice Award for Choice Movie: Chemistry\\\",\\\"Teen Choice Award for Choice Movie: Liplock\\\",\\\"Teen Choice Award for Choice Movie Scene Stealer\\\"]\",\"s\":false},{\"n\":\"MAIN_SUBJECT\",\"v\":\"terrorism\",\"s\":false},{\"n\":\"TITLE\",\"v\":\"Captain America: The Winter Soldier\",\"s\":true},{\"n\":\"BUDGET\",\"v\":\"1.7E8\",\"s\":false},{\"n\":\"CAST\",\"v\":\"[\\\"Robert Redford\\\",\\\"Chris Evans\\\",\\\"Scarlett Johansson\\\",\\\"Sebastian Stan\\\",\\\"Anthony Mackie\\\",\\\"Cobie Smulders\\\",\\\"Frank Grillo\\\",\\\"Georges St-Pierre\\\",\\\"Samuel L.

Loosely based on the German fairy tale \\\"Rapunzel\\\" in the collection of folk tales published by the Brothers Grimm, it is the 50th Disney animated feature film. Featuring the voices of Mandy Moore, Zachary Levi and Donna Murphy, the film tells the story of Rapunzel, a lost, young princess with magical long blonde hair who yearns to leave her secluded tower. Against her foster mother's wishes, she accepts the aid of an intruder to take her out into the world which she has never seen.  Before the film's release, its title was changed from Rapunzel to Tangled , reportedly to market the film gender-neutrally. Tangled spent six years in production at a cost that has been estimated at $260 million, which, if accurate, would make it the most expensive animated film ever made and one of the most expensive films of all time. The film employed a unique artistic style by blending together features of computer-generated imagery (CGI) and traditional animation while using non-photorealistic rendering to create the impression of a painting. Composer Alan Menken, who had worked on prior Disney animated features, returned to score Tangled.  Tangled premiered at the El Capitan Theatre on November 14, 2010, and went into general release on November 24. The film earned $592 million in worldwide box office revenue, $200 million of which was earned in the United States and Canada, making it the eighth highest-grossing film of 2010, and was praised by critics and audiences for its animation, writing, characters, and musical score. The film was nominated for a number of awards, including Best Original Song at the 83rd Academy Awards. The film was released on Blu-ray and DVD on March 29, 2011; a short film, Tangled Ever After , was released later in 2012 and a television series premiered in 2017.\",\"s\":false},{\"n\":\"vertex_prop_boolean_8\",\"v\":\"false\",\"s\":false},{\"n\":\"NOMINATIONS\",\"v\":\"\",\"s\":false},{\"n\":\"MAIN_SUBJECT\",\"v\":\"false imprisonment\",\"s\":false},{\"n\":\"TITLE\",\"v\":\"Tangled\",\"s\":true},{\"n\":\"BUDGET\",\"v\":\"2.6E8\",\"s\":false},{\"n\":\"CAST\",\"v\":\"[\\\"novalue\\\"]\",\"s\":false},{\"n\":\"MOVIE_ID\",\"v\":\"2961\",\"s\":false},{\"n\":\"GENRES\",\"v\":\"[\\\"Musical\\\",\\\"Fantasy\\\",\\\"Comedy\\\",\\\"Family\\\",\\\"Animation\\\"]\",\"s\":false},{\"n\":\"personalized_salsa\",\"v\":\"0.0020887993194467864\",\"s\":true},{\"n\":\"RUNTIME\",\"v\":\"100.0\",\"s\":false},{\"n\":\"AWARDS\",\"v\":\"\",\"s\":false},{\"n\":\"LIST_PRICE\",\"v\":\"4.99\",\"s\":false},{\"n\":\"YEAR\",\"v\":\"2010.0\",\"s\":false},{\"n\":\"SKU\",\"v\":\"XJQ19504\",\"s\":false},{\"n\":\"VIEWS\",\"v\":\"2243.0\",\"s\":false},{\"n\":\"OPENING_DATE\",\"v\":\"2010-11-24T00:00\",\"s\":false}],\"l\":[\"MOVIE\"],\"g\":[\"M\"]}],\"edges\":[],\"paths\":[],\"totalNumResults\":20},\"table\":\"TITLE\\tPERSONALIZED_SALSA\\nAvengers: Age of Ultron\\t0.0036556235993819536\\nHome Alone\\t0.0035397173018878085\\nGuardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2\\t0.0027785065126835814\\nBatman v Superman: Dawn of Justice\\t0.002737897667218343\\nJurassic World\\t0.0026426756346159775\\nAlien\\t0.0025028110238925192\\nCaptain America: The Winter Soldier\\t0.002397729807848848\\nRaiders of the Lost Ark\\t0.002298283288360003\\nMulan\\t0.0021737783839732333\\nIron Man 3\\t0.0020921654479594083\\nTangled\\t0.0020887993194467864\\nThe Hunger Games\\t0.001997433360410588\\nX-Men: Days of Future Past\\t0.0018175375473642498\\nThe Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring\\t0.0018120989193342488\\nThe Big Lebowski\\t0.001772247585212711\\nThe Goonies\\t0.0017213229052752742\\nOcean's Eleven\\t0.001705959285226276\\nScream\\t0.0016764880857344261\\nThe Matrix Reloaded\\t0.0015857773908105645\\nUp\\t0.0015558181532053807\"}",

It is based on the Chinese legend of Hua Mulan, and was Disney's 36th animated feature and the ninth animated film produced and released during the Disney Renaissance. It was directed by Tony Bancroft and Barry Cook, with story by Robert D. San Souci and screenplay by Rita Hsiao, Philip LaZebnik, Chris Sanders, Eugenia Bostwick-Singer, and Raymond Singer. Ming-Na Wen, Eddie Murphy, Miguel Ferrer and BD Wong star in the English version, while Jackie Chan provided the voice of Captain Li Shang for the Chinese dubs of the film. The film's plot takes place in China during the Han dynasty, where Fa Mulan, daughter of aged warrior Fa Zhou, impersonates a man to take her father's place during a general conscription to counter a Hun invasion.  Produced and released during the Disney Renaissance, Mulan was the first of three features produced primarily at the Disney animation studio at Disney-MGM Studios (now Disney's Hollywood Studios) in Bay Lake, Florida. Development for the film began in 1994, when a number of artistic supervisors were sent to China to receive artistic and cultural inspiration. Mulan was well received by critics and the public who praised the animation, plot, characters (particularly the eponymous character), and musical score, and grossed over $304 million. It earned a Golden Globe and Academy Award nomination and won several Annie Awards, including Best Animated Feature. It was then followed by Mulan II in 2004, a direct-to-video sequel.

It is a follow-up to Man of Steel (2013) and the second installment in the DC Extended Universe (DCEU). The film was directed by Zack Snyder, written by Chris Terrio and David S. Goyer, and features an ensemble cast that includes Ben Affleck, Henry Cavill, Amy Adams, Jesse Eisenberg, Diane Lane, Laurence Fishburne, Jeremy Irons, Holly Hunter, and Gal Gadot. Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice is the first live-action film to feature Batman and Superman together, as well as the first live-action cinematic portrayal of Wonder Woman. In the film, criminal mastermind Lex Luthor manipulates Batman into a preemptive battle with Superman, with whom Luthor is obsessed.  The film was announced at the 2013 San Diego Comic-Con after the release of Man of Steel. Snyder stated that the film would take inspiration from the Batman comic book series The Dark Knight Returns by Frank Miller but clarified that it would follow an original premise. The incarnation of Batman in the film is different from the character's previous portrayal in The Dark Knight Trilogy , serving as a cinematic reboot of the character. The film is also inspired by narrative elements from the \\\"Death of Superman\\\". Pre- production began at East Los Angeles College in October 2013, with principal photography starting in May 2014 in Detroit. Additional filming also took place in Illinois and New Mexico, concluding that December.  Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice premiered at the Auditorio Nacional in Mexico City on March 19, 2016, and was released in the United States on March 25, 2016, in 2D, 3D, premium large formats, and 70 mm prints by Warner Bros. Pictures. Following a strong debut that set new box office records, the film experienced a historic drop in its second weekend and never recovered. Despite turning a profit, it was deemed a box office disappointment and received generally unfavorable reviews from critics for its tone, screenplay, and pacing, though some praised its visual style and acting performances. An extended cut dubbed the \\\"Ultimate Edition\\\", which features 31 minutes of additional footage, was released digitally on June 28, 2016, and on Blu-ray on July 19, 2016.

Based on a story by O'Bannon and Ronald Shusett, it follows the crew of the commercial space tug Nostromo , who encounter the eponymous Alien, an aggressive and deadly extraterrestrial set loose on the ship. The film stars Tom Skerritt, Sigourney Weaver, Veronica Cartwright, Harry Dean Stanton, John Hurt, Ian Holm, and Yaphet Kotto. It was produced by Gordon Carroll, David Giler, and Walter Hill through their company Brandywine Productions, and was distributed by 20th Century Fox. Giler and Hill revised and made additions to the script; Shusett was executive producer. The Alien and its accompanying artifacts were designed by the Swiss artist H. R. Giger, while concept artists Ron Cobb and Chris Foss designed the more human settings.  Alien premiered May 25, 1979, as the opening night of the fourth Seattle International Film Festival, presented in 70mm at midnight. It received a wide release on June 22 and was released September 6 in the United Kingdom. It was met with critical acclaim and box-office success, winning the Academy Award for Best Visual Effects, three Saturn Awards (Best Science Fiction Film, Best Direction for Scott, and Best Supporting Actress for Cartwright), and a Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation, along with numerous other nominations. It has been consistently praised in the years since its release, and is considered one of the greatest films of all time. In 2002, Alien was deemed \\\"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\\\" by the Library of Congress and was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry. In 2008, it was ranked by the American Film Institute as the seventh-best film in the science-fiction genre, and as the 33rd-greatest film of all time by Empire.  The success of Alien spawned a media franchise of films, novels, comic books, video games, and toys. It also launched Weaver's acting career, providing her with her first lead role. The story of her character's encounters with the Alien creatures became the thematic and narrative core of the sequels Aliens (1986), Alien 3 (1992), and Alien Resurrection (1997). A crossover with the Predator franchise produced the Alien vs. Predator films: Alien vs. Predator (2004) and Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem (2007).

It is the fourth installment of the Jurassic Park franchise and the first in the Jurassic World trilogy. Directed by Colin Trevorrow, written by Rick Jaffa and Amanda Silver, alongside Derek Connolly and Trevorrow from a story by Jaffa and Silver, and produced by Frank Marshall and Patrick Crowley, the film stars Chris Pratt, Bryce Dallas Howard, Vincent D'Onofrio, Ty Simpkins, Nick Robinson, Omar Sy, BD Wong, and Irrfan Khan. Set 22 years after the events of Jurassic Park , Jurassic World takes place on the same fictional island of Isla Nublar, located off the Pacific coast of Costa Rica. A successful theme park of cloned dinosaurs, dubbed Jurassic World, has operated on the island for years, bringing John Hammond's dream to fruition. The park plunges into chaos when a transgenic dinosaur escapes from its enclosure and goes on a rampage, while a conspiracy orchestrated by the park's staff creates more dangers.  Universal Pictures intended to begin production of a fourth Jurassic Park film in 2004 for a mid-2005 release but was in development hell while the script underwent several revisions. Following a suggestion from executive producer Steven Spielberg, writers Jaffa and Silver explored the idea of a functional dinosaur park. Once Trevorrow was hired as director in 2013, he followed the same idea while developing a new script with Connolly. Filming lasted from April to August 2014 in Louisiana and Hawaii. The dinosaurs were created by Industrial Light & Magic using CGI and by Legacy Effects using life-sized animatronics. Production was completed in May 2015.   Jurassic World was released in the United States on June 12, 2015. The film received generally positive reviews from critics and grossed $1.6 billion in box office revenue, reaching third among the highest-grossing films of all time. It was also the second-highest-grossing film of 2015 and the highest- grossing in the franchise. The sequel, Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom , was released in June 2018. Jurassic World Camp Cretaceous , an animated series set concurrently with the events of Jurassic World , was released in September 2020 on Netflix.

Produced by David Heyman and written by Steve Kloves, it is the sequel to Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (2004) and the fourth instalment in the Harry Potter film series. The film stars Daniel Radcliffe as Harry Potter, with Rupert Grint as Ron Weasley, and Emma Watson as Hermione Granger. Its story follows Harry's fourth year at Hogwarts as he is chosen by the Goblet of Fire to compete in the Triwizard Tournament.  The film is the first of the series to receive a PG-13 certificate in the US, and a 12A in the UK. Filming began in early 2004. The Hogwarts scenes were shot at the Leavesden Film Studios. Five days after its release, the film had grossed over US$102 million at the North American box office, which is the third-highest first-weekend tally for a Harry Potter film behind Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 1 and Part 2. Goblet of Fire enjoyed an immensely successful run at the box office, earning $896 million worldwide, which made it the highest-grossing film of 2005 and the sixth- highest-grossing film in the Harry Potter series.  The film was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Art Direction, and won the BAFTA Award for Best Production Design. Goblet of Fire was the second film in the series to be released in IMAX. The film is one of the best- reviewed instalments within the series, being praised for the higher level of maturity and sophistication of its characters, plotline, tone, screenplay, and the performances of the lead actors.

It is the sequel to Iron Man (2008) and Iron Man 2 (2010), and the seventh film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). The film was directed by Shane Black from a screenplay he co-wrote with Drew Pearce, and stars Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark / Iron Man alongside Gwyneth Paltrow, Don Cheadle, Guy Pearce, Rebecca Hall, Stéphanie Szostak, James Badge Dale, Jon Favreau, and Ben Kingsley. In Iron Man 3 , Tony Stark wrestles with the ramifications of the events of The Avengers during a national terrorism campaign on the United States led by the mysterious Mandarin.  After the release of Iron Man 2 in May 2010, director Favreau chose not to return for a third film. Black was hired to write and direct the sequel in February 2011, working with Pearce to make the script more character-centric, focus on thriller elements, and use concepts from Warren Ellis's \\\"Extremis\\\" comic book story arc. The film's supporting cast, including Kingsley, Pearce, and Hall, were brought on throughout April and May 2012. Filming took place from May 23 to December 17, 2012, primarily at EUE/Screen Gems Studios in Wilmington, North Carolina. Additional filming took place around North Carolina as well as in Florida, Los Angeles, and China; an extended version of the film specifically for Chinese audiences was created. Seventeen companies provided the film's visual effects.  Iron Man 3 premiered at the Grand Rex in Paris on April 14, 2013, and released in the United States on May 3, as the first film in Phase Two of the MCU. It received positive reviews from critics, with praise for its action sequences and Downey's performance. The film was a box office success, grossing over $1.2 billion worldwide making it the second highest-grossing film of 2013 and the sixteenth film to gross over $1 billion. At the time it also became the fifth-highest-grossing film of all time while its opening weekend became the sixth-highest of all time.

Written and directed by James Gunn, the film stars an ensemble cast featuring Chris Pratt, Zoe Saldana, Dave Bautista, Vin Diesel, Bradley Cooper, Michael Rooker, Karen Gillan, Pom Klementieff, Elizabeth Debicki, Chris Sullivan, Sean Gunn, Sylvester Stallone, and Kurt Russell. In Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 , the Guardians travel throughout the cosmos as they help Peter Quill learn more about his mysterious parentage.  The film was officially announced at the 2014 San Diego Comic-Con International before the theatrical release of the first film, along with James Gunn's return from the first film, with the title of the sequel revealed a year later in June 2015. Principal photography began in February 2016 at Pinewood Atlanta Studios in Fayette County, Georgia, with many crew changes from the first film due to other commitments. Filming concluded in June 2016. James Gunn chose to set the sequel shortly after the first film to explore the characters' new roles as the Guardians, and to follow the storyline of Quill's father established throughout that previous film. Russell was confirmed as Quill's father in July 2016, portraying Ego, a departure from Quill's comic father.  Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 premiered in Tokyo on April 10, 2017, and was released in the United States on May 5, 2017, as part of Phase Three of the MCU.

The film centers on an elderly widower named Carl Fredricksen (Ed Asner) and an earnest boy named Russell (Jordan Nagai); by tying thousands of balloons to his house, Carl sets out to fulfill his dream to see the wilds of South America and complete a promise made to his late wife, Ellie. The film was directed by Pete Docter and co-directed by Bob Peterson, who also wrote the film's screenplay with Docter, as well as the story with Tom McCarthy. The music was composed by Michael Giacchino, who had also composed music for The Incredibles and Ratatouille.  Docter began working on the story in 2004 called Heliums , which was based on fantasies of escaping from life when it becomes too irritating. He and eleven other Pixar artists spent three days in Venezuela gathering research and inspiration. The designs of the characters were caricatured and stylized considerably, and animators were challenged with creating realistic cloth. It was Pixar's first film to be presented in Disney Digital 3-D.   Up was released on May 29, 2009, and opened the 2009 Cannes Film Festival, becoming the first animated and 3-D film to do so. The film grossed over $735 million, becoming the sixth highest-grossing film of 2009. The film received widespread acclaim from critics and audiences, with many calling it one of the best animated films of all time. The characters, themes, narrative, Asner's vocal performance and Giacchino's score were praised, as was the montage of Carl and his wife Ellie growing old together. The film won two Academy Awards, including Best Animated Feature, and was nominated for three more, including Best Picture, making it the second animated film in history to receive such a nomination (and the first Pixar film to do so), following Beauty and the Beast (1991).\",\"s\":false},{\"n\":\"VIEWS\",\"v\":\"2571.0\",\"s\":false},{\"n\":\"LIST_PRICE\",\"v\":\"3.99\",\"s\":false},{\"n\":\"CAST\",\"v\":\"[\\\"novalue\\\"]\",\"s\":false},{\"n\":\"RUNTIME\",\"v\":\"96.0\",\"s\":false},{\"n\":\"NOMINATIONS\",\"v\":\"[\\\"Academy Award for Best Sound Editing\\\",\\\"Academy Award for Best Writing, Original Screenplay\\\",\\\"Academy Award for Best Picture\\\",\\\"Academy Award for Best Animated Feature\\\",\\\"Academy Award for Best Original Score\\\"]\",\"s\":false},{\"n\":\"BUDGET\",\"v\":\"1.75E8\",\"s\":false},{\"n\":\"MOVIE_ID\",\"v\":\"3783\",\"s\":false},{\"n\":\"AWARDS\",\"v\":\"[\\\"Academy Award for Best Animated Feature\\\",\\\"Academy Award for Best Original Score\\\",\\\"Genesis Award\\\",\\\"National Board of Review: Top Ten Films\\\"]\",\"s\":false},{\"n\":\"CREW\",\"v\":\"[{\\\"job\\\":\\\"producer\\\",\\\"names\\\":[\\\"Jonas Rivera\\\"]},{\\\"job\\\":\\\"director\\\",\\\"names\\\":[\\\"Pete Docter\\\",\\\"Bob Peterson\\\"]},{\\\"job\\\":\\\"screenwriter\\\",\\\"names\\\":[\\\"Pete Docter\\\",\\\"Bob Peterson\\\"]}]\",\"s\":false},{\"n\":\"TITLE\",\"v\":\"Up\",\"s\":true}],\"l\":[\"MOVIE\"],\"g\":[\"M\"]},{\"_id\":\"MOVIE(1413)\",\"p\":[{\"n\":\"personalized_salsa\",\"v\":\"0.001307534941538787\",\"s\":true},{\"n\":\"MAIN_SUBJECT\",\"v\":\"\",\"s\":false},{\"n\":\"GENRES\",\"v\":\"[\\\"Fantasy\\\",\\\"Adventure\\\",\\\"Family\\\"]\",\"s\":false},{\"n\":\"vertex_prop_boolean_8\",\"v\":\"false\",\"s\":false},{\"n\":\"OPENING_DATE\",\"v\":\"2002-11-03T00:00\",\"s\":false},{\"n\":\"YEAR\",\"v\":\"2002.0\",\"s\":false},{\"n\":\"GROSS\",\"v\":\"8.78979634E8\",\"s\":false},{\"n\":\"STUDIO\",\"v\":\"[\\\"Heyday Films\\\",\\\"1492 Pictures\\\",\\\"Warner Bros.\\\"]\",\"s\":false},{\"n\":\"SKU\",\"v\":\"BHV3901\",\"s\":false},{\"n\":\"SUMMARY\",\"v\":\"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is a 2002 fantasy film directed by Chris Columbus and distributed by Warner Bros.

It is the second installment in the Indiana Jones franchise, a prequel to the 1981 film Raiders of the Lost Ark , featuring Harrison Ford reprising his role as the title character and the second film to use THX technology after Return of the Jedi. After arriving in India, Indiana Jones is asked by desperate villagers to find a mystical stone and rescue their children from a Thuggee cult practicing child slavery, black magic, and ritualistic human sacrifice in honor of the goddess, Kali.  Not wishing to feature the Nazis as the villains again, George Lucas, executive producer and co-writer, decided to regard this film as a prequel. Three plot devices were rejected before Lucas wrote a film treatment that resembled the final storyline. Lawrence Kasdan, Lucas's collaborator on Raiders of the Lost Ark , turned down the offer to write the script, and Willard Huyck and Gloria Katz were hired as his replacements, who had previously worked with Lucas on American Graffiti.  The film was released to financial success but initial reviews were mixed, criticizing its darker elements and violence. However, critical opinion has improved since 1984, citing the film's intensity and imagination. In response to some of the more violent sequences in the film, and with similar complaints about Gremlins , Spielberg suggested that the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA) alter its rating system, which it did within two months of the film's release, creating a new PG-13 rating.  It was released to cinemas in the United States on May 23, 1984. It was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Original Score and won the Academy Award for Best Visual Effects.

It is the sequel to Fast Five (2011) and the sixth installment in the Fast & Furious franchise. It stars Vin Diesel, Paul Walker, Dwayne Johnson, Michelle Rodriguez, Jordana Brewster, Tyrese Gibson, Chris \\\"Ludacris\\\" Bridges, Sung Kang, Gal Gadot, Luke Evans, Gina Carano, and John Ortiz. In the film, Dominic Toretto, Brian O'Conner, and the team are offered amnesty for their past crimes in exchange for apprehending a mercenary organization, one member of which is Toretto's presumed dead lover, Letty Ortiz.  After departing from the overt street racing theme of previous installments in Fast Five , development of Fast & Furious 6 continues this, featuring spy and adventure elements, in the hopes to increase the series' audience. Preparation for the film began in April 2011, with Diesel and Lin returning that June. Discussions arose filming alongside a potential seventh installment; these were abandoned once principal photography began in July 2012, which lasted until that December, with filming locations including Los Angeles, London, Glasgow, and the Canary Islands.  Fast & Furious 6 premiered in London on May 17, 2013, and was theatrically released worldwide in conventional and IMAX theaters by Universal Pictures on May 24. The film received generally positive reviews from critics, with praise for the stunts and action sequences. It grossed $788.7 million worldwide, making it the sixth-highest-grossing film of 2013, the then-fourth highest grossing film distributed by Universal, and the then-highest grossing installment in the franchise.

The film stars David Arquette, Neve Campbell, Courteney Cox, Matthew Lillard, Rose McGowan, Skeet Ulrich, and Drew Barrymore. Released on December 20, it follows the character of Sidney Prescott (Campbell), a high school student in the fictional town of Woodsboro, California, who becomes the target of a mysterious killer in a Halloween costume known as Ghostface. The film combines black comedy and \\\"whodunit\\\" mystery with the violence of the slasher genre to satirize the clichés of the horror movie genre popularized in films such as Halloween (1978), Friday the 13th (1980) and Craven's own A Nightmare on Elm Street (1984). Scream was considered unique at the time of its release for featuring characters who were aware of real-world horror films and openly discussed the clichés that the film attempted to subvert.  Inspired by the real-life case of the Gainesville Ripper, Scream was influenced by Williamson's passion for horror films, especially Halloween (1978). The script, originally titled Scary Movie , was bought by Dimension Films and was retitled by the Weinstein Brothers just before filming was complete. The production faced censorship issues with the Motion Picture Association of America and obstacles from locals while filming on location. The film received positive reviews and was a financial success, earning $173 million worldwide, becoming the highest-grossing slasher film until the release of Halloween (2018). It still remains the highest-grossing slasher film in adjusted dollars. It received several awards and award nominations. The soundtrack by Marco Beltrami was also acclaimed, and was cited as \\\"[one] of the most intriguing horror scores composed in years\\\". The score has since earned \\\"cult status\\\". Scream marked a change in the genre as it cast already-established and successful actors, which was considered to have helped it find a wider audience, including a significant female viewership.  Scream was credited with revitalizing the horror genre in the 1990s, which was considered to be almost dead following an influx of direct-to-video titles and numerous sequels to established horror franchises of the 1970s and 1980s. These sequels drew decreasing financial and critical success, as they exploited clichés upon which films in the genre had become reliant. Scream 's success spawned a series of sequels, though only Scream 2 , released the following year, achieved an equal level of commercial and critical success. In the years following the release of Scream and its sequels, they were accused of inspiring and even inducing violent crimes and murders.\",\"s\":false},{\"n\":\"VIEWS\",\"v\":\"3002.0\",\"s\":false},{\"n\":\"LIST_PRICE\",\"v\":\"2.99\",\"s\":false},{\"n\":\"CAST\",\"v\":\"[\\\"David Arquette\\\",\\\"Neve Campbell\\\",\\\"Courteney Cox\\\",\\\"Matthew Lillard\\\",\\\"Rose McGowan\\\",\\\"Skeet Ulrich\\\",\\\"Drew Barrymore\\\",\\\"Jamie Kennedy\\\",\\\"Joseph Whipp\\\",\\\"Liev Schreiber\\\",\\\"Frances Lee McCain\\\",\\\"Henry Winkler\\\",\\\"Wes Craven\\\",\\\"Roger L.

The film follows a young boy as he defends his home from two burglars after his family accidentally leaves him behind in Chicago on their vacation to Paris.  Hughes conceived the film while preparing to go on vacation. Warner Bros. originally intended to finance and distribute the film, but shut down production after it exceeded its assigned budget, and 20th Century Fox assumed responsibilities following secret meetings with Hughes. Columbus and Culkin were soon cast, and filming took place between February and May 1990 on location across Illinois.  Home Alone premiered in Chicago on November 10, 1990, and was theatrically released in the United States on November 16. Upon release, it became a financial success and received positive reviews, with praise for its cast, humor, and music. Home Alone grossed $476.7 million worldwide, becoming the highest-grossing live-action comedy until the release of The Hangover Part II (2011), and made Culkin a child star. It was nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture – Musical or Comedy, and Best Actor in a Motion Picture – Musical or Comedy for Culkin, and for the Academy Award for Best Original Score for John Williams, and Best Original Song for \\\"Somewhere in My Memory\\\".

Produced by Walt Disney Pictures and Jerry Bruckheimer, the film is based on Walt Disney's Pirates of the Caribbean attraction at Disney theme parks. The story follows pirate Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) and blacksmith Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) as they rescue the kidnapped Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley) from the cursed crew of the Black Pearl , captained by Hector Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush), who become undead skeletons in moonlight.  Jay Wolpert developed a script in 2001, and Stuart Beattie rewrote it in early 2002. Around that time, producer Jerry Bruckheimer became involved in the project; he had Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio work on the script, adding the plot device of a supernatural curse to the story to bring it in line with the original theme park ride. Filming took place from October 2002 to March 2003 in Saint Vincent and the Grenadines and on sets constructed around Los Angeles, California. It was also notable for being the first film released under the Walt Disney Pictures banner to be rated PG-13 by the MPAA.  The film's world premiere was held at Disneyland Park in Anaheim, California on June 28, 2003. Despite low expectations, the film was a huge box-office success, grossed $654.3 million worldwide; making it the fourth-highest- grossing film of 2003. It received generally positive reviews from critics, with Depp's performance receiving universal acclaim. The film has been widely cited as the film that launched Depp as a box office leading man after many years as a cult movie star. Depp won the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Leading Role, in addition to Best Actor nominations at the Academy Awards, BAFTAs, and Golden Globes. The Curse of the Black Pearl was also nominated for four other Academy Awards and BAFTAs. The film became the first in a franchise, with two back-to-back sequels, Dead Man's Chest and At World's End , released in 2006 and 2007.

The film, which combines computer animation with live- action filming, was directed by Michael Bay, with Steven Spielberg serving as executive producer. It was produced by Don Murphy and Tom DeSanto, and is the first installment in the live-action Transformers film series. The film stars Shia LaBeouf as Sam Witwicky, a teenager who gets caught up in a war between the heroic Autobots and the villainous Decepticons, two factions of alien robots who can disguise themselves by transforming into everyday machinery, primarily vehicles. The Autobots intend to retrieve and use the AllSpark, the powerful artifact that created their robotic race that is on Earth, to rebuild their home planet Cybertron and end the war, while the Decepticons have the intention of using it to build an army by giving life to the machines of Earth. Tyrese Gibson, Josh Duhamel, Anthony Anderson, Megan Fox, Rachael Taylor, John Turturro, and Jon Voight also star, while voice actors Peter Cullen and Hugo Weaving voice Optimus Prime and Megatron respectively.  Murphy and DeSanto developed the project in 2003, and DeSanto wrote a treatment. Steven Spielberg came on board the following year, hiring Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman to write the screenplay. The U.S. Armed Forces and General Motors (GM) loaned vehicles and aircraft during filming, which saved money for the production and added realism to the battle scenes. Hasbro's promotional campaign for the film included deals with various companies; advertising included a viral marketing campaign, coordinated releases of prequel comic books, toys, and books, as well as product placement deals with companies such as GM, Burger King, and eBay.  Transformers received mixed reviews from critics and a positive response from audiences. It became the fifth highest-grossing film of 2007, grossing $709 million worldwide, with an estimated 46 million tickets sold in the US. The film won four awards from the Visual Effects Society and was nominated for three Academy Awards, for Best Sound Editing, Best Sound Mixing, and Best Visual Effects. LaBeouf's performance was praised by Empire , and Cullen's reprisal of Optimus Prime from the 1980s television series was well received by fans. The film was followed by four sequels, Revenge of the Fallen (2009), Dark of the Moon (2011), Age of Extinction (2014), and The Last Knight (2017), as well as a spin-off titled Bumblebee in 2018.\",\"s\":false},{\"n\":\"VIEWS\",\"v\":\"2653.0\",\"s\":false},{\"n\":\"LIST_PRICE\",\"v\":\"3.99\",\"s\":false},{\"n\":\"CAST\",\"v\":\"[\\\"Shia LaBeouf\\\",\\\"Tyrese Gibson\\\",\\\"Josh Duhamel\\\",\\\"Anthony Anderson\\\",\\\"Megan Fox\\\",\\\"Rachael Taylor\\\",\\\"John Turturro\\\",\\\"Jon Voight\\\",\\\"Michael O'Neill\\\",\\\"Bernie Mac\\\",\\\"Kevin Dunn\\\",\\\"Julie White\\\",\\\"Amaury Nolasco\\\",\\\"Darius McCrary\\\",\\\"Glenn Morshower\\\",\\\"Hugo Weaving\\\",\\\"Jess Harnell\\\",\\\"Peter Cullen\\\",\\\"Zack Ward\\\",\\\"Odette Annable\\\",\\\"John Robinson\\\",\\\"Travis Van Winkle\\\",\\\"Andy Milder\\\",\\\"Michelle Pierce\\\",\\\"Chris Ellis\\\",\\\"Mark Ryan\\\",\\\"Brian Stepanek\\\",\\\"Samantha Smith\\\",\\\"Tom Everett\\\",\\\"Michael Bay\\\",\\\"Colton Haynes\\\",\\\"Michael Shamus Wiles\\\",\\\"C.

Lucas conceived Raiders of the Lost Ark in the early 1970s. Seeking to modernize the serial films of the early 20th-century, he developed the idea further with Kaufman, who suggested the Ark as the film's goal. Lucas eventually focused on developing his 1977 space opera Star Wars. Development on Raiders of the Lost Ark resumed that year when he shared the idea with Spielberg, who joined the project several months later. While the pair had ideas for set pieces and stunts for the film, they hired Kasdan to fill in the narrative gaps between them. Principal photography began in June 1980 on a $20 million budget and concluded the following September. Filming took place on sets at Elstree Studios, England, and on location mainly in La Rochelle, France, Tunisia, and Hawaii.  Though prerelease polling showed little audience interest in the film, especially compared to the superhero film Superman II , Raiders of the Lost Ark became the highest-grossing film of 1981, earning approximately $330.5 million worldwide, and played in some theaters for over a year. It was a critical success, receiving praise for its modern take on the serial film, its non-stop action and adventure, and the cast, particularly Ford, Allen, and Freeman. The film was nominated for several awards and, among others, won five Academy Awards, seven Saturn Awards, and one BAFTA.  Raiders of the Lost Ark is now considered one of the greatest films ever made and has had a lasting impact on popular culture, spawning a host of imitators across several media, and inspired other filmmakers. The United States Library of Congress selected it for preservation in the National Film Registry in 1999. Raiders of the Lost Ark is the first entry in what would become the Indiana Jones franchise, which includes three more films— Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom (1984), Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade (1989), and Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull (2008)—a television series, video games, comic books, novels, theme park attractions, toys, and an amateur remake. A fifth film is scheduled for release in 2022.\",\"s\":false},{\"n\":\"VIEWS\",\"v\":\"5068.0\",\"s\":false},{\"n\":\"LIST_PRICE\",\"v\":\"3.99\",\"s\":false},{\"n\":\"CAST\",\"v\":\"[\\\"John Rhys-Davies\\\",\\\"Harrison Ford\\\",\\\"Karen Allen\\\",\\\"Denholm Elliott\\\",\\\"Paul Freeman\\\",\\\"Ronald Lacey\\\",\\\"William Hootkins\\\",\\\"Alfred Molina\\\",\\\"Sonny Caldinez\\\",\\\"George Harris\\\",\\\"Wolf Kahler\\\",\\\"Anthony Higgins\\\",\\\"Vic Tablian\\\",\\\"Don Fellows\\\",\\\"Frank Marshall\\\",\\\"Eddie Tagoe\\\",\\\"Pat Roach\\\",\\\"Tutte Lemkow\\\",\\\"Dennis Muren\\\"]\",\"s\":false},{\"n\":\"RUNTIME\",\"v\":\"115.0\",\"s\":false},{\"n\":\"NOMINATIONS\",\"v\":\"[\\\"Academy Award for Best Director\\\",\\\"Academy Award for Best Cinematography\\\",\\\"Academy Award for Best Film Editing\\\",\\\"Academy Award for Best Picture\\\",\\\"Academy Award for Best Production Design\\\",\\\"Academy Award for Best Original Score\\\",\\\"Academy Award for Best Sound\\\",\\\"Academy Award for Best Visual Effects\\\"]\",\"s\":false},{\"n\":\"BUDGET\",\"v\":\"20.0\",\"s\":false},{\"n\":\"MOVIE_ID\",\"v\":\"2471\",\"s\":false},{\"n\":\"AWARDS\",\"v\":\"[\\\"National Film Registry\\\",\\\"Academy Award for Best Film Editing\\\",\\\"Academy Award for Best Production Design\\\",\\\"Academy Award for Best Sound\\\",\\\"Academy Award for Best Visual Effects\\\",\\\"National Board of Review: Top Ten Films\\\"]\",\"s\":false},{\"n\":\"CREW\",\"v\":\"[{\\\"job\\\":\\\"producer\\\",\\\"names\\\":[\\\"George Lucas\\\",\\\"Frank Marshall\\\",\\\"Howard Kazanjian\\\"]},{\\\"job\\\":\\\"director\\\",\\\"names\\\":[\\\"Steven Spielberg\\\"]},{\\\"job\\\":\\\"screenwriter\\\",\\\"names\\\":[\\\"Lawrence Kasdan\\\",\\\"George Lucas\\\",\\\"Philip Kaufman\\\"]}]\",\"s\":false},{\"n\":\"TITLE\",\"v\":\"Raiders of the Lost Ark\",\"s\":true}],\"l\":[\"MOVIE\"],\"g\":[\"M\"]},{\"_id\":\"MOVIE(3409)\",\"p\":[{\"n\":\"personalized_salsa\",\"v\":\"0.001503026990219617\",\"s\":true},{\"n\":\"MAIN_SUBJECT\",\"v\":\"telepresence\",\"s\":false},{\"n\":\"GENRES\",\"v\":\"[\\\"Sci-Fi\\\",\\\"Action\\\"]\",\"s\":false},{\"n\":\"vertex_prop_boolean_8\",\"v\":\"false\",\"s\":false},{\"n\":\"OPENING_DATE\",\"v\":\"2003-11-05T00:00\",\"s\":false},{\"n\":\"YEAR\",\"v\":\"2003.0\",\"s\":false},{\"n\":\"GROSS\",\"v\":\"4.27343298E8\",\"s\":false},{\"n\":\"STUDIO\",\"v\":\"[\\\"Warner Bros.\\\",\\\"Village Roadshow Pictures\\\",\\\"Silver Pictures\\\"]\",\"s\":false},{\"n\":\"SKU\",\"v\":\"ZQT21853\",\"s\":false},{\"n\":\"SUMMARY\",\"v\":\"The Matrix Revolutions is a 2003 American science fiction action film written and directed by the Wachowskis., It was the third installment in The Matrix film series, released six months following The Matrix Reloaded.

It is the sequel to Captain America: The First Avenger (2011) and the ninth film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). The film was directed by Anthony and Joe Russo from a screenplay by the writing team of Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely. It stars Chris Evans as Steve Rogers / Captain America alongside Scarlett Johansson, Sebastian Stan, Anthony Mackie, Cobie Smulders, Frank Grillo, Emily VanCamp, Hayley Atwell, Robert Redford, and Samuel L. Jackson. In the film, Captain America joins forces with Black Widow and Falcon to uncover a conspiracy within the spy agency S.H.I.E.L.D. while facing a mysterious assassin known as the Winter Soldier.  Markus and McFeely began writing the sequel around the release of The First Avenger in July 2011. The script draws from the Winter Soldier story arc in the comic books written by Ed Brubaker as well as conspiracy fiction from the 1970s such as Three Days of the Condor (1975). The film explores S.H.I.E.L.D., similarly to how the first film explored the U.S. military, after Rogers was shown working for the agency in the MCU crossover film The Avengers (2012). The Russo brothers signed to direct in June 2012 and casting began the following month. Filming began in April 2013 in Los Angeles, California, before moving to Washington, D.C., and Cleveland, Ohio. The directors used practical effects and intense stunt work, but also 2,500 visual effects shots created by six companies.  Captain America: The Winter Soldier premiered in Los Angeles on March 13, 2014, and was released in the United States on April 4, as part of Phase Two of the MCU. The film became a critical and commercial success, grossing over $714 million worldwide, making it the seventh-highest-grossing film of 2014, and received an Academy Award nomination for Best Visual Effects. A sequel titled Captain America: Civil War , also directed by the Russos, was released in 2016.\",\"s\":false},{\"n\":\"VIEWS\",\"v\":\"3838.0\",\"s\":false},{\"n\":\"LIST_PRICE\",\"v\":\"0.0\",\"s\":false},{\"n\":\"CAST\",\"v\":\"[\\\"Robert Redford\\\",\\\"Chris Evans\\\",\\\"Scarlett Johansson\\\",\\\"Sebastian Stan\\\",\\\"Anthony Mackie\\\",\\\"Cobie Smulders\\\",\\\"Frank Grillo\\\",\\\"Georges St-Pierre\\\",\\\"Samuel L.

Loosely based on the German fairy tale \\\"Rapunzel\\\" in the collection of folk tales published by the Brothers Grimm, it is the 50th Disney animated feature film. Featuring the voices of Mandy Moore, Zachary Levi and Donna Murphy, the film tells the story of Rapunzel, a lost, young princess with magical long blonde hair who yearns to leave her secluded tower. Against her foster mother's wishes, she accepts the aid of an intruder to take her out into the world which she has never seen.  Before the film's release, its title was changed from Rapunzel to Tangled , reportedly to market the film gender-neutrally. Tangled spent six years in production at a cost that has been estimated at $260 million, which, if accurate, would make it the most expensive animated film ever made and one of the most expensive films of all time. The film employed a unique artistic style by blending together features of computer-generated imagery (CGI) and traditional animation while using non-photorealistic rendering to create the impression of a painting. Composer Alan Menken, who had worked on prior Disney animated features, returned to score Tangled.  Tangled premiered at the El Capitan Theatre on November 14, 2010, and went into general release on November 24. The film earned $592 million in worldwide box office revenue, $200 million of which was earned in the United States and Canada, making it the eighth highest-grossing film of 2010, and was praised by critics and audiences for its animation, writing, characters, and musical score. The film was nominated for a number of awards, including Best Original Song at the 83rd Academy Awards. The film was released on Blu-ray and DVD on March 29, 2011; a short film, Tangled Ever After , was released later in 2012 and a television series premiered in 2017.\",\"s\":false},{\"n\":\"VIEWS\",\"v\":\"2243.0\",\"s\":false},{\"n\":\"LIST_PRICE\",\"v\":\"4.99\",\"s\":false},{\"n\":\"CAST\",\"v\":\"[\\\"novalue\\\"]\",\"s\":false},{\"n\":\"RUNTIME\",\"v\":\"100.0\",\"s\":false},{\"n\":\"NOMINATIONS\",\"v\":\"\",\"s\":false},{\"n\":\"BUDGET\",\"v\":\"2.6E8\",\"s\":false},{\"n\":\"MOVIE_ID\",\"v\":\"2961\",\"s\":false},{\"n\":\"AWARDS\",\"v\":\"\",\"s\":false},{\"n\":\"CREW\",\"v\":\"[{\\\"job\\\":\\\"producer\\\",\\\"names\\\":[\\\"John Lasseter\\\",\\\"Glen Keane\\\"]},{\\\"job\\\":\\\"executive producer\\\",\\\"names\\\":[\\\"John Lasseter\\\"]},{\\\"job\\\":\\\"director\\\",\\\"names\\\":[\\\"Byron Howard\\\",\\\"Nathan Greno\\\"]},{\\\"job\\\":\\\"screenwriter\\\",\\\"names\\\":[\\\"Dan Fogelman\\\"]}]\",\"s\":false},{\"n\":\"TITLE\",\"v\":\"Tangled\",\"s\":true}],\"l\":[\"MOVIE\"],\"g\":[\"M\"]}],\"edges\":[],\"paths\":[],\"totalNumResults\":20},\"table\":\"TITLE\\tPERSONALIZED_SALSA\\nHome Alone\\t0.0035397173018878085\\nGuardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2\\t0.0027785065126835814\\nBatman v Superman: Dawn of Justice\\t0.002737897667218343\\nJurassic World\\t0.0026426756346159775\\nAlien\\t0.0025028110238925192\\nCaptain America: The Winter Soldier\\t0.002397729807848848\\nRaiders of the Lost Ark\\t0.002298283288360003\\nMulan\\t0.0021737783839732333\\nIron Man 3\\t0.0020921654479594083\\nTangled\\t0.0020887993194467864\\nOcean's Eleven\\t0.001705959285226276\\nScream\\t0.0016764880857344261\\nUp\\t0.0015558181532053807\\nPirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl\\t0.0015404039462336434\\nIndiana Jones and the Temple of Doom\\t0.0015038899746610199\\nThe Matrix Revolutions\\t0.001503026990219617\\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire\\t0.0014697182499794946\\nTransformers\\t0.0014533483923713474\\nFast & Furious 6\\t0.001447834956856266\\nHarry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets\\t0.001307534941538787\"}",
