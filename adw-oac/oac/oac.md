# Using Oracle Analytics Cloud (OAC)

## Introduction

**Oracle Analytics Cloud** provides the industry's most comprehensive cloud analytics in a single unified platform, including everything from self-service visualization and powerful inline data preparation to enterprise reporting, advanced analytics, and self-learning analytics that deliver proactive insights.

You are going to use an **Oracle Analytics Cloud** instance to give your end users a self-service approach to analyzing the data.

### Objectives

- **Create a connection** from Oracle Analytics Cloud to Autonomous Database
- **Prepare** a dataset
- **Create Visualizations** to analyze data

Estimated Lab Time: 75 minutes.

## Task 1: Create the connection from Oracle Analytics Cloud to Autonomous Database

**Oracle Autonomous Database** only accepts secure connections to the database. This requires a **'wallet'** file that contains the SQL\*NET
configuration files and the secure connection information. Wallets are used by client utilities such as SQL Developer, SQL\*Plus etc. For this
workshop, you will use this same wallet mechanism to make a connection from OAC to the **Autonomous Database**.

> **Note**: This section assumes you have already created your Oracle Analytics Cloud instance as part of the 'Lab 2 - Provisioning your Oracle Analytics Cloud (OAC)' instance section. If not, please return to the beginning of Lab2 and go through the instance creation.

1. Download your Autonomous Database wallet.

    **You need first to download the wallet file** containing your credentials. There are two types of wallets:

    - **Instance Wallet**: Wallet for a single database only; this provides a database-specific wallet

    - **Regional Wallet**: Wallet for all Autonomous Databases for a given tenant and region (this includes all service instances that a cloud account owns)

    > **Note**: Oracle recommends you provide a database-specific wallet, using Instance Wallet, to end users and for application use whenever possible. Regional wallets should only be used for administrative purposes that require potential access to all Autonomous Databases within a region.

2. Click the **Navigation Menu** in the upper left, navigate to **Oracle Database**, and select **Autonomous Data Warehouse**.

	![Oracle Console SignIn](https://oracle-livelabs.github.io/common/images/console/database-adw.png " ")

    You can see all the **ADW** instances that you have **created**.
    **Select** the instance that we created before.

    ![ADW databases list](./images/adw-databases-list.png)

3. On the "**Autonomous Database Details**" page for your Autonomous Database, click the **DB Connection** button.

    You can access to the '**Autonomous Database Details**' page using the **cloud console** page.

    ![ADW DB Console](./images/adw-db-console-new.png)

    This will open a pop-up window. Select Wallet Type **Instance Wallet** and then **Download Wallet**.

    ![Oracle Wallet](./images/oracle-wallet.png)

   You will be asked to provide a **password** for the wallet. The password must meet the rules for the **Oracle Cloud password** complexity. This password is a password that you need to remember for your **wallet**. You can use the **admin password** that you created before.

4. Select **Download** and save the wallet to your **local machine**.

    ![Oracle Wallet Download](./images/oracle-wallet-downloaod.png)

5. You can now **Close** the **Database Connection** pop up window.

    ![Oracle Wallet Close](./images/oracle-wallet-download-close.png)

6. Use the Wallet in Oracle Analytics Cloud

    **Return** to the **Oracle Cloud Infrastructure console** and click on the menu icon on the left.
    **Navigate** to **Analytics** and then **Analytics Cloud**.

    ![OAC Web Console](https://oracle-livelabs.github.io/common/images/console/analytics-oac.png " ")

7. **Open** the Cloud Analytics **URL** associated with your instance (the one that we created in Lab 2) by using the dots menu button on the right-hand side of your instance information and selecting **Open URL**.

    ![Cloud Analytics URL](./images/oac-url.png)

    The **Oracle Analytic**s page will open in a new browser **window/tab**.

8. On the top right-hand side of the screen, click **Create**, and then **Connection**.

    ![Connection Creation](./images/connection-creation-new.png)

9. Choose **Oracle Autonomous Data Warehouse**.

    ![Connection Creation - ADW](./images/connection-creation-adw.png)

    Use the following information to configure your **connection**.

    I recommend selecting first the autonomous database wallet zip file you just downloaded in ***Client Credentials*** field. It will automatically extract the required *cwallet.sso* and then **autocomplete** several of the fields for you. Later on you just have to review and modify them if need it.

    - **Connection Name**: WORKSHOPADWOAC
        ```
        <copy>WORKSHOPADWOAC</copy>
        ```

    - **Client Credentials**: Use the Browse button to upload the **wallet zip > file** that you downloaded. It will automatically extract the cwallet.sso file from this zip bundle.

    - **Username**: `ADMIN` -- We have created this user on the ADW instance creation.
        ```
        <copy>ADMIN</copy>
        ```

    - **Password**: The password that you created on the ADW instance creation at the beginning of the workshop.

    - **Service Name**: Choose the name of your database followed by the \_high suffix.

    ![Connection Creation - ADW - WORKSHOPADWOAC](./images/conecction-details-new.png)

10. Select **Save** to save your new connection **information**.

## Task 2: Prepare the dataset

When you create a project, you add one or more **data sets** containing the data that you want to ** and explore**. Data sets contain data
from subject areas, Oracle Applications, databases, or uploaded data files such as spreadsheets. You can also add multiple data sets to your
existing projects.

1. On the top right-hand side of the **Oracle Analytics** Home Page, click **Create**, and then **Data Set**.

    ![Data Set Creation](./images/dataset-new.png)

2. Select **WORKSHOPADWOAC**, the connection you **created** in the previous step.

    ![Data Set Creation - WORKSHOPADWOAC](./images/dataset-creation-adw.png)

3. In the next window, click on the  **Schemas** section. We will **SH** (Sales History) for the workshop purpose.
 
    The **SH schema** provides a small data set you can use to run the sample queries in the [Oracle Database Data Warehousing Guide](https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/oracle-database/19/dwhsg/sql-analysis-reporting-data-warehouses.html#GUID-1D8E3429-735B-409C-BD16-54004964D89B).

    For more information on the SH schema see [*Sample Schemas*](https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/oracle-database/19/comsc/introduction-to-sample-schemas.html#GUID-844E92D8-A4C8-4522-8AF5-761D4BE99200) and [*Schema Diagrams*](https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/oracle-database/19/comsc/schema-diagrams.html#GUID-D268A4DE-BA8D-428E-B47F-80519DC6EE6E).

    ![Data Set Creation - WORKSHOPADWOAC SH Schema](./images/sh-schema-new.png)

    Let's start by analyzing the **Sales History** schema's table.
    
    ![Data Set Creation - Ready](./images/dataset-ready-new.png)

4. Drag and Drop **SALES** table from the **SH schema** into the white canvas. Wait a few seconds until all the fields from **SALES** have been added to the canvas. You should see something similar to the following screenshoot.

    ![OAC - Sales](./images/oac-sales-new.png)

    This will display the columns available in the **SALES** table.
    

5. Click on the **SALES Page** at the bottom of the page to **Edit** and **Prepare** the data for the visualizations that we will do in the next Task.

    ![OAC - Sales Add](./images/oac-sales-canvas-edit.png)


6. All the number-type columns from this table are treated as **MEASURE** by default. You can check the information on the **Properties** section of each table column under the Data Type section.

    Confirm that:
    - **PROD&#95;ID**
    - **CHANNEL&#95;ID**
    - **PROMO&#95;ID** 
    
    have **Data Type** are **Number** and **Treat As** are **ATTRIBUTE**. 

    For reviewing or/and making changes of these fields, select one field at the time and change **MEASURE** to **ATTRIBUTE** the information on the **Properties** section of each table column under the Data Type section.
    
    ![SH-SALES CHANNEL&#95;ID Properties Measure](./images/channel-id-measure.png)
    
7. We need to make a few more **modifications** on the table fields before we built the visualizations. 
    
    This time we will change the **Aggregation rule** to **CUST&#95;ID** from **SUM** to **Count Distinct** from the COLUMNS Properties panel from the left bottom.

    ![SH-SALES CUST&#95;ID Properties Aggregation](./images/cust-id-aggregation.png)


8. We will **Save the Dataset** by clicking the **Save Database bottom** on the superior part of the screen and select **Save**. Here you have the information that we need:

    - **Name**: SH&#95;SALES
        ```
        <copy>SH&#95;SALES</copy>
        ```
    - **Description**: (Optional)
    

    ![OAC - Sales Add](./images/oac-sales-add-save.png)
    ![OAC - Sales Add](./images/oac-sales-added.png)

9. The **Data Set** was successfully **added**.

    ![OAC - Sales Add](./images/oac-sales-canvas.png)

## Task 3: Create Visualizations using your data sets

1. Create a new project by clicking **Create Workbook**.

    ![Data Set - Create Workbook](./images/dataset-create-workbook.png)

    A new screen with a **white canvas** is opened using the **SH&#95;SALES Data Set** you created.

    ![OAC - White canvas](./images/oac-white-canvas-new.png)

    Before drowning into details, let us give you a quick **explanation** of the different parts of this screen. This will help you to easily follow the next steps.

    An **Oracle Analytics Project** consists of **three main parts** (you can see them at the top right part of the screen):

    ![OAC Navigation](./images/oac-navigation-new.png)

    - **Data**: Here is where you configure your data. You get a preview of each dataset on the project. You enrich it by adding columns, hiding or renaming the available ones. You can also define joins between datasets here.

    - **Visualize**: Here is where you explore and Analyze the data. You can create several canvases to hold the different visualizations you define.

    - **Present**: Here is where you create a more presentation-oriented view of the analysis you created. This tab allows you to choose which insights to show and add comments and descriptions. It helps to understand your analysis journey and focus on showing the results.

    During this workshop, you will use the **Present** and **Visualize** tabs mainly.

    You have already seen the **Prepare** screen on previous steps. The **Visualize** screen is this one:

    ![OAC - Canvas explanation](./images/oac-canvas-explanation.png)

    Main areas to note here are:

    - **Explorer**: Contains all fields from your datasets to be used in the project

    - **Properties box**: Allows you to define the properties and parameters of the selected object. If it is a column it will be highlighted in blue (in the screen PROD_ID in the Explorer menu is selected), if it is a graphic from the canvas it will have a thin blue borderline around it

    - **Graph Definition**: Contains definition of the selected Visualization, which fields to use and where (Axis, Filters, Trellis Groups...)

    - **Canvas**: Your play area. You can place your visuals here. You can also create more Canvases and copy/move visuals around

2. Select **AMOUNT&#95;SOLD** column from the **TABLE panel** and check if **Aggregation** rule is **SUM** from the COLUMNS detail **panel from the bottom**. By default **Aggregation** value, should be **SUM** but we just want to be sure.

    ![SH-SALES Aggregation](./images/sh-sales-aggreation.png)

3. We will **add Month** to your selection: **Hold the Control Button on your Keyboard** and expand **TIME_ID** and select **Month**, after right click of your mouse and select **Create Best Visualization**.

    ![SH-SALES Create Visualization](./images/sh-sales-visualization.png)

4. Verify that the **information** that is showing in the canvas is the following:

    **Line, Values (Y-Axis) &#45;&#45; AMOUNT&#95;SOLD, Category (X-Axis) &#45;&#45; TIME&#95;ID (Month)**.

    ![SH-SALES Verify information](./images/sh-sales-verify-information.png)

5. Right click on the chart, select **Add Statistics** and **Trend Line**.

    ![SH-SALES - Add Statistics](./images/sh-sales-add-statistics.png)

6. In the **Properties** panel at the very bottom of the page in the **Trend** section change **95%** to **Off**.

    ![SH-SALES - Properties](./images/sh-sales-add-statistics-properties.png)
    ![SH-SALES - Trend](./images/sh-sales-add-statistics-trend.png)

    Although we had some ups and downs in the **totals**, you see that in the overall the total amount sold has been trending up, meaning our **sales are in good shape**.

    We will compare this information (**AMOUNT&#95;SOLD by TIME&#95;ID (Month)**) to our active customer base over time. To find the number of active customers, we will "**count distinct**" on **CUST&#95;ID on a Monthly basis**.

7. Select **CUST_ID** column from the **TABLE panel**. We modified the **Aggregation rule** to **Count Distinct** in Task 2 of this Lab, when we prepared the data. Now its time to use it.

    Be sure you drag and drop **CUST&#95;ID** column to the Values (**Y-Axis**) section with your mouse in the canvas. Be sure it is added **AMOUNT&#95;SOLD** and not replace it. Right click on **CUST&#95;ID** and select **Y2 Axis** as part of the **CUST&#95;ID** details.

    ![SH-SALES Aggregation Drag](./images/sh-sales-add-aggregation-drag.png)

    ![SH-SALES canvas](./images/sh-sales-canvas.png)

    This **results** shows you that the number of customers is going down but the amount sold is going up, so we are **selling more to less customers**.

8. We will **Save the Workbook** by clicking the **Save Workbook** bottom on the superior part of the screen and select **Save**. Here you have the information that we need:

    - **Name**: Visualization
        ```
        <copy>Visualization</copy>
        ```
    - **Description**: (Optional)
        
    ![OAC - Sales Add](./images/oac-save-workbook.png)
    ![OAC - Sales Add](./images/oac-workbook-saved.png)

9. We will create a **new Data Set** of data to enrich the **canvas**.

    Click the **+** bottom in the left top corner of the Analytics Cloud Page and **Add Data Set**.

    ![Add New Data Set](./images/new-dataset-new.png)

10. Select **Create Data Set**.

    ![Create Data Set](./images/new-dataset-create.png)

11. Select **WORKSHOPADWOAC**.

    ![Create Data Set - WORKSHOPADWOAC](./images/data-set-workshopadwoac.png)

12. Click on the  **Schemas** section. We will **SH** (Sales History) for the workshop purpose.

    ![Data Set Creation - WORKSHOPADWOAC SH Schema](./images/sh-schema-new.png)

    Let's start by analyzing the **Sales History** schema's table.
    
    ![Data Set Creation - Ready](./images/dataset-ready-new.png)

13. Drag and Drop **PRODUCTS** table from the **SH schema** into the white canvas. Wait a few seconds until all the fields from **PRODUCTS** have been added to the canvas. You should see something similar to the following screenshoot.

    ![OAC - Sales](./images/oac-products.png)

    This will display the columns available in the **PRODUCTS** table.

14. We will **Save the Dataset** by clicking the **Save Database** bottom on the superior part of the screen and select **Save**. Here you have the information that we need:

    - **Name**: SH&#95;PRODUCTS
        ```
        <copy>SH&#95;PRODUCTS</copy>
        ```
    - **Description**: (Optional)

    ![OAC - Sales Add](./images/oac-sales-add-save.png)
    ![OAC - Sales Add](./images/oac-products-added.png)

15. The **Data Set** was successfully **added**.

    ![OAC - Sales Add](./images/oac-products-canvas.png)

16. Now we have to **join** the new Data Set, **SH&#95;PRODUCT**, to the data set that we created a few steps before **SH&#95;SALES**.

    If you haven't been redirected to the **Data** section of the project, please go now.

    At the **bottom of the screen**, you can see three tabs, one per each dataset and another one called **Data Diagram**. **Click** on **Data Diagram**.

    ![Connect Sources SH_SALES](./images/connect-sources-sh-sales.png)
    
    In this tab, you can view a representation of the **different datasets** included in the project and their **relationships**. Currently, there is just **SH_SALES** data set included.
    
17. Click **Add Dataset** at the top of the page to include **SH_PRODUCTS** data set in the equation.

    ![Connect Sources SH_SALES Add source](./images/connect-sources-sh-sales-add.png)

18. Select **SH_PRODUCTS** and **Add to Workbook**.

    ![Connect Sources SH_SALES Add source](./images/connect-sources-sh-sales-sh-products.png)

19. We have created a relationship between the two datasets connected by **PROD_ID**. We can see a **number 1** bertween the data sets.

    ![Connect Sources SH_SALES Add source](./images/relationship-between-datasets.png)

20. We can find more information about the match better datasets clicking in the line connecting both. A **pop-up window** appears showing **Blend Data** screen between the datasets (join). In this case, **PROD_ID**, as we mentioned before.

    ![Connect Sources - Add Match](./images/blend-data.png)

21. Now that the **preparation** of the data is done, you can navigate again to **Visualize** page in the right top corner of the **Analytics Cloud Home Page**.

    ![OAC Navigation](./images/oac-navigation-new.png)

22. In the canvas go to **TIME_ID** section, **Show by** and select **Quarter** instead Month.

    ![OAC canvas Quarter](./images/oac-canvas-quarter.png)

23. Apply the **Quarter** filter and the graph will **change dynamically**.

    ![OAC canvas Quarter Change Dynamically](./images/oac-canvas-quarter-change-dynamically.png)

    We will eliminate the **Linear Trend Line** that we have in the graph.

24. Click in the **graph** and in the **Properties section** of the bottom of the page, select the **Analytics** icon and click in the **Trend** section to remove the **Linear** section.

    ![OAC canvas Modify](./images/oac-canvas-modify.png)

25. We can see the **graph without the Trend Linear line**.

    ![OAC canvas Trend Linear](./images/oac-canvas-trend-linear.png)

26. Select **PRODUCT_CATEGORY** from **SH&#95;PRODUCTS** and add it in the **Trellis Columns** section of the canvas.

    ![OAC canvas Trellis Columns](./images/oac-canvas-trellis-columns.png)

    ![OAC canvas Trellis Columns 2](./images/oac-canvas-trellis-columns2.png)

    You can see now a **Trend** on the **AMOUNT&#95;SOLD** and the number of distinct customers by product category. This allows you to compare the performance of each product. However, using just lines can be a bit messy. You will try now to make this graphic more appealing.

27. Select **AMOUNT&#95;SOLD** from the canvas and select **Bar** graph.

    ![OAC canvas - Bar](./images/oac-canvas-bar.png)

28. Select **Workbook Properties** from the **Burger Menu** in the right top corner.

    ![OAC canvas - Project Properties](./images/oac-canvas-project-properties.png)
    ![OAC canvas - Project Properties Actions](./images/oac-canvas-project-properties-actions.png)

29. Select in the **Color Series** and select another **color** that you prefer.

    ![OAC canvas - Project Properties Colour](./images/oac-canvas-project-properties-colour.png)

30. Select **OK** after applying the **color changes**.

    ![OAC canvas - Project Properties Select Colour](./images/oac-canvas-project-properties-colour-select.png)

    ![OAC canvas - Project Properties New Colour](./images/oac-canvas-project-properties-colour-select-new.png)

31. We will save the **Workbook** again. Click in the **Save** section.

    ![OAC canvas - Save](./images/oac-canvas-save-new.png)

32. You can share your project by **email or social media**. Have a look at the **possibilities**.

    Select the Share icon and select **File or Print**.

    ![OAC canvas - File or Print](./images/oac-canvas-file-print-new.png)

33. You can choose to **Save** your project in a wide variety of standard formats such as **PowerPoint (pptx), Acrobat (pdf), Image (png), Data (csv), Package (dva)**.  You can choose which parts of your project to include, such as **All Canvas, only the Active Canvas or the Active Visual**.

    ![OAC canvas - Save Options](./images/oac-canvas-save-options-new.png)
    ![OAC canvas - Save Options Types](./images/oac-canvas-save-options-type.png)

    The file will be **downloaded** locally on your machine.

    ![OAC canvas - Download](./images/oac-canvas-download-new.png)

34. When you select **Print**, you can choose which parts of your project to include in the **Printed output, such as All Canvas, only the Active Canvas or the Active Visual**, etc.
