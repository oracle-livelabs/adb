# Provisioning your Oracle Analytics Cloud (OAC) instance

## Introduction

This section describes the process of deploying **Oracle Analytics Cloud** instances on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Gen 2, which is the default for newly provisioned accounts in **EMEA** and **US**.

Your Oracle Cloud Free Tier account will use the Oracle Cloud Free Trial **credits** while this instance is provisioned, as Oracle Analytics Cloud is not part of the **Always Free** cloud services.

Provisioning an Oracle Analytics Cloud instance can take over **40 minutes**.

Watch our short video that explains how to provision your Oracle Analytics Cloud instance:

### Objectives
- Create an Oracle Analytics Cloud Instance

## Task 1: Create an Oracle Analytics Cloud (OAC) Instance

Return to the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Console accessing from **Oracle Home Page** (oracle.com) and sign in into your cloud account.
Click in **View Account** and **Sign in to Cloud**.

1. Click on the menu icon on the left. Verify that you are signed in as a **Single Sign On** (Federated user) user by selecting the **Profile** icon in the top right hand side of your screen. If your username is shown as:

    - oracleidentitycloudservice/&lt;your username&gt;
    
    Then you are **connected** as a **Single Sign On** user.

    If your username is shown as:

    -  &lt;your username&gt;
    
    Then you are **signed in** as an **Oracle Cloud Infrastructure**Â user.

    If your user does not contain the identity provider (**oracleidentitycloudprovider**), please logout and select to authenticate
    using **Single Sign On**.

    To be capable of using **Oracle Analytics Cloud** we need to be Sign-On as a **Single Sign-On** (SSO) user.

    For more information about federated users, see [User Provisioning for Federated Users](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Identity/Tasks/usingscim.htm).

2. Return to the **Home Console Page** and navigate to **Analytics & AI** section and then **Analytics Cloud**.
