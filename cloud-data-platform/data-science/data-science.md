    ![](./images/10.png " ")

7. Now you have successfully created a Data Science platform project and notebook session, which is integrated with your VCN and Compute instance for all the networking and computation needs of your data science work.

## Task 3: Navigate to the OCI Data Science Notebook Session Interface

1. After a few moments, the **notebook session** should be created. You may have to wait a few minutes and refresh the page to see it. To access it, click on **Open**.

    ![](./images/11.png " ")

2. You are now inside the notebook session and can see a file directory hierarchy on the left with some pre-included notebooks that you can explore. On the right window, you can select different options to start up in your notebook session such as a terminal or a python notebook.

    ![](./images/12.png " ")

3. Let's import a notebook to see the capabilities of the platform. Download the sample notebook by clicking on this link: [sampleNotebook]( https://c4u04.objectstorage.us-ashburn-1.oci.customer-oci.com/p/EcTjWk2IuZPZeNnD_fYMcgUhdNDIDA6rt9gaFj_WZMiL7VvxPBNMY60837hu5hga/n/c4u04/b/livelabsfiles/o/austindatamanagement/sampleNotebook.ipynb)

4. Now, let's download the datasets for this project- there are 3 you will download. For the first, download by clicking on this link: [sampleDataset](https://c4u04.objectstorage.us-ashburn-1.oci.customer-oci.com/p/EcTjWk2IuZPZeNnD_fYMcgUhdNDIDA6rt9gaFj_WZMiL7VvxPBNMY60837hu5hga/n/c4u04/b/livelabsfiles/o/austindatamanagement/sampleDataset.csv). For the second, download by clicking on this link: [trainDataset](https://c4u04.objectstorage.us-ashburn-1.oci.customer-oci.com/p/EcTjWk2IuZPZeNnD_fYMcgUhdNDIDA6rt9gaFj_WZMiL7VvxPBNMY60837hu5hga/n/c4u04/b/livelabsfiles/o/austindatamanagement/trainDataset.csv). For the third and final dataset, download by clicking on this link: [testDataset](https://c4u04.objectstorage.us-ashburn-1.oci.customer-oci.com/p/EcTjWk2IuZPZeNnD_fYMcgUhdNDIDA6rt9gaFj_WZMiL7VvxPBNMY60837hu5hga/n/c4u04/b/livelabsfiles/o/austindatamanagement/testDataset.csv)

5. Then, start by clicking on the **^ icon** to **Upload Files** in the OCI Data Science notebook session interface. Then, select the datasets from the previous step to import it. It may take a minute for them to completely upload the dataset, but it will continue the upload process in the background. You may still continue to the next step.

    ![](./images/12b.png " ")

6. Then, click on the **^ icon** again to **Upload Files** in the OCI Data Science notebook session interface. Then, select the notebook downloaded from the previous step to import.

7. Open the notebook by double clicking on its name in the left pane.

    ![](./images/13.png " ")

8. Take a moment to look through the different sections of the notebook. You will find all the typical steps of a machine learning pipeline in place. Additionally note that there are multiple approaches showcased in the notebook. For one, you can see a standard open source data science approach and how that can be done in the platform. Additionally, in OCI DataScience, you have access to Oracle's Accelerated Data Science (ADS) library, giving you access to AutoML capabilities to help greatly accelerate your machine learning and data science work. With ADS, you can use a few lines of code to create multiple models from many different algorithms, parameters, and data set slices. This would typically require extensive programming knowledge and many more lines of code with standard open source libraries. Feel free to take a look at the differences between the open source approach in the sample notebook and the Oracle ADS AutoML approach.

    ![](./images/14.png " ")

9. Feel free to run the notebook and see the machine learning algorithms run right before your eyes. To do that, navigate to the top menu bar, click on **Run** and then click on **Run All Cells**. Again, note the runtime for the open source libraries approach and for the Oracle ADS AutoML library approach.

    ![](./images/15.png " ")

10. Congratulations, you have now ran a notebook which leverages data science and machine learning capabilities to help detect and predict fraud in data that you have now as well as data that you may get in the future!

11. Bonus: if you have an existing Oracle Autonomous Data Warehouse (ADW) or want to spin one up, feel free to check out the bonus module (module 4) in the sample notebook you imported earlier and configure it with your ADW details.

## Task 4: (Bonus) Explore Model Catalog

1. With the model that you created in the previous step inside of the notebook, they can also stored in OCI's Model Catalog. This is a repository for your models which can be accessed in a variety of ways. Let's look at how we can do that by exploring an OCI DS included example notebook. Learn more by clicking on **File** and then on **New Launcher**. Then, click on **Notebook Examples**.

    ![](./images/17.png " ")

1. Scroll down to then click on **model_catalog.ipynb** and click on **Load Example**.

    ![](./images/18.png " ")

2. In this notebook, you can learn about how to save your models in model catalog for further use. The models that you ran earlier could be stored in a model catalog repository to be available for further use, sharing, or exploring. There are a variety of metrics and metadata that can be seen from a quick glance.

    ![](./images/19.png " ")

## Task 5: (Bonus) Set up Oracle Cloud Shell and Oracle Functions

1. Let's try to deploy our newly created machine learning model using Oracle Functions. This allows us to use a lightweight method, that can be used outside of OCI Data Science, to test payloads for whether or not they are fraud.

2. Download the ADS-Model-Deployment notebook by clicking on this link: [ADS-Model_Deployment.ipynb](https://c4u04.objectstorage.us-ashburn-1.oci.customer-oci.com/p/EcTjWk2IuZPZeNnD_fYMcgUhdNDIDA6rt9gaFj_WZMiL7VvxPBNMY60837hu5hga/n/c4u04/b/livelabsfiles/o/austindatamanagement/ADS-Model-Deployment.ipynb). Then, similarly to how you uploaded a file before, begin by clicking on the **^ icon** to **Upload Files** in the OCI Data Science notebook session interface. Then, select the ADS notebook from the previous step to import it.

    ![](./images/12b.png " ")

3. Follow the steps outlined to deploy your models through functions.
