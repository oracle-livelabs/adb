11. You now have created your first Autonomous Data Warehouse instance. Have a look at your instance's details here including its name, database version, CPU count and storage size.

    ![](./images/Part_1_Step_2_6.png " ")

## Task 2: Download the Connection Wallet
As ADW only accepts secure connections to the database, you need to download a wallet file containing your credentials first. The wallet can be downloaded either from the instance's details page, or from the ADW service console. In this case, we will be showing you how to download the wallet file from the instance's details page. This wallet file can be used with a local version of software such as SQL Developer as well as others. It will also be used later in the lab so make note of where it is stored.

1. Go back to the Oracle Cloud Console and open the Instances screen. Find your database, click the action menu and select **DB Connection**.

    ![](./images/8.png " ")

2. Click **Download Wallet**.

    ![](./images/9.png " ")

3. Specify a password of your choice for the wallet. You will need this password when connecting to the database via SQL Developer later, and is also used as the JKS keystore password for JDBC applications that use JKS for security. Click **Download** to download the wallet file to your client machine. Download the wallet to a location you can easily access, because we will be using it in the next step.
*Note: If you are prevented from downloading your Connection Wallet, it may be due to your browser's pop-blocker. Please disable it or create an exception for Oracle Cloud domains.*

    ![](./images/Part_2_Step_6_3.png " ")


4. You will download a dataset file from this workshop to load into your APEX app. You can download it by clicking on the following text link: [Download Transactions_History.xlsx here](https://objectstorage.us-ashburn-1.oraclecloud.com/p/CSv7IOyvydHG3smC6R5EGtI3gc1vA3t-68MnKgq99ivKAbwNf8BVnXVQ2V3H2ZnM/n/c4u04/b/livelabsfiles/o/solutions-library/Transactions_History.xlsx). Then, open your browser window again back to the APEX page.


5. Continue by clicking on **Load Data** which allows you to load CSV, XLSX, XML, and JSON data.

    ![](./images/Part_2_Step_6_4.png " ")

6. Click **Choose File** and select **Transactions_History.xlsx** that you just downloaded. 

    ![](./images/Part_2_Step_6_5.png " ")

7. A preview will pop up where you can view some details about the data you are loading. Proceed by entering in a **Table Name**. For this lab, use **TRANSACTION_HISTORY** for the table name. For primary keys, leave the **Identity Column** option selected.

    ![](./images/Part_2_Step_6_6.png " ")

8. Finish by clicking on **Load Data**.

    ![](./images/Part_2_Step_6_7.png " ")

9. A table creation confirmation page should show up. Continue by clicking on **View Table** to view the table that has been added to your ADW through APEX.

    ![](./images/Part_2_Step_6_9.png " ")

10. You will download another dataset file from this workshop to load into your APEX app. You can download it by clicking on the following text link: [Download US_CENSUS.csv here](https://objectstorage.us-ashburn-1.oraclecloud.com/p/CSv7IOyvydHG3smC6R5EGtI3gc1vA3t-68MnKgq99ivKAbwNf8BVnXVQ2V3H2ZnM/n/c4u04/b/livelabsfiles/o/solutions-library/US_CENSUS.csv). 


11. Then, open your browser window and navigate back to the **Data Workshop** section in APEX to then click **Load Data** again for this new file.

    ![](./images/Part_2_Step_6_3.png " ")

12. Choose **US_CENSUS.csv** as the data file to create a table. When loading in this table, keep the table options as shown below.

    ![](./images/Part_2_Step_6_18.png " ")

13. Confirm that the two data files you loaded have been imported as tables.

    ![](./images/Part_2_Step_6_17.png " ")

14. Now that the data has been loaded in, we have to make a minor change to one of the columns' data type.  With the  **TRANSACTION_HISTORY** table selected, click on **Modify Column**.

    ![](./images/Part_2_Step_6_19.png " ")

15. We want to modify the data type for the Date of Sale column.  To do this, select **DATE\_OF\_SALE (DATE)** from the **Column** dropdown.  Next, select **TIMESTAMP** from the **Datatype** dropdown.  Once you have made these selections, you can click **Next**.

    ![](./images/Part_2_Step_6_20.png " ")

16. The next screen asks you to confirm your column modification request.  To confirm, click **Finish**.

    ![](./images/Part_2_Step_6_21.png " ")

You have now changed the data type for the Date of Sale column from a Date to a Timestamp.  When the data was loaded into APEX, this column was automatically configured as a Date data type, only including the calendar date of the sale.  When we switch this column to a Timestamp data type, we not only get the calendar date of the sale, but also the time of day that the sale occurred. This will come into play when we run our Machine Learning models in Lab 200.


## Task 7: Create an App in APEX

1. You will download another data file from this workshop to create your APEX app. You can download it by clicking on the following text link: [Download ApexApp.sql here](https://objectstorage.us-ashburn-1.oraclecloud.com/p/CSv7IOyvydHG3smC6R5EGtI3gc1vA3t-68MnKgq99ivKAbwNf8BVnXVQ2V3H2ZnM/n/c4u04/b/livelabsfiles/o/solutions-library/ApexApp.sql). Then, open your browser window again back to the APEX page.

2. To start creating an app, click on **App Builder** on the top navigation bar.  Next, click on **Import**.
