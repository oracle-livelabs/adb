### Workshop Overview

*Complete AI Portfolio:*
Oracle offers a complete portfolio of products, services, and differentiated capabilities to power your enterprise with artificial intelligence. For business users, Oracle offers ready-to-go AI-powered cloud applications with intelligent features that drive better business outcomes. With Oracle’s ready-to-build AI platform, data scientists and application developers have a full suite of cloud services to build, deploy, and manage AI-powered solutions. With Oracle’s ready-to-work Autonomous Database, machine learning is working behind the scenes to automate security patching, backups, and optimize database query performance, which helps to eliminate human error and repetitive manual tasks so organizations can focus on higher-value activities.

This is the first of several labs that are part of the **Oracle’s Cloud Data Platform
Autonomous-Driven & AI-Infused** workshop. This workshop will walk you through the process of using the Autonomous Data Warehouse for storing analytical datasets and applying Machine Learning models in order to learn the correlation between different attributes and predict the future demand while leveraging Application Express to create a simple application as well as link to a 3rd party web app. These features will also be integrated through the bonus use of a chatbot that you can interact with using natural language.

You will take on 2 Personas during the workshop. The **Data Scientist Persona** will prepare the data for training and validating the machine learning models and apply those models in order to predict the future demand. The **Business Analyst Persona** will also build and apply Machine Learning models using Oracle Analytics Cloud service without writing a single line of code. During the workshop, you will get exposure to Oracle Autonomous Data Warehouse (ADW), Oracle Machine Learning tool (OML), Oracle Analytics Cloud Service (OAC), Oracle Application Express (APEX), Oracle Rest Data Service (ORDS), and the Oracle Digital Assistant (ODA) chatbot. Learn how to use Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Data Science for fraud protection. Secure data using Oracle Data Safe and monitor the entire solution using Oracle Management Cloud (OMC).

Here is an example of that Cloud Data Platform Architecture which can be extended with further Oracle services such as federation through Identity Cloud Service (IDCS) and Oracle Integration Cloud (OIC):
