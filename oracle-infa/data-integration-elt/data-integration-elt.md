# Pushdown Optimization With Cloud Data Integration 

## Introduction

In this lab, we will learn how to build a Cloud Data Integration mapping to move data from a staging table in Oracle Autonomous Database (ADB) to target in Oracle ADB using pushdown optimization. This will enhance and improve the data pipeline performance by converting and processing logic to native ecosystem commands and SQL queries for faster processing at lower cost while ensuring data stays within the ecosystem.

Estimated Time: 25 minutes

### Objectives

In this lab, you will:
* Learn how to use pushdown optimization or ELT with Cloud Data Integration
* Learn to set up mapping tasks for the mappings built in IDMC Cloud Data Integration service
