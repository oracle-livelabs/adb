# Perform Cloud Data Profiling 

## Introduction

Informatica Cloud Data Profiling is one of several services available in Informatica Data Management Cloud Services. Data Profiling is an on-demand service that you can use to create data profiling tasks. You can create and run a data profiling task on a data source to determine the quality of data and understand the completeness, conformity, and consistency of data.

In this lab, we will profile RtlCustomer table and examine the profile results to understand the data content and discover data anomalies which may include non-standard patterns, non-standard values and inconsistent representation of data.

Estimated Time: 15 minutes

### Objectives

In this lab, you will:
* Learn how to use the cloud data profiling service to profile the source data and find out the data inconsistencies
* Learn to identify the outliers, different inconsistent patterns, duplicate values, null values, etc
