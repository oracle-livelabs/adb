# Validating Peoplesoft Schema Objects on ADB-S

## Introduction

This lab walks you through the steps to validate PeopleSoft schema objects on ADB-S

Estimated Time: 5 minutes


### Objectives

In this lab, you will:
* Validate PeopleSoft schema objects after MV2ADB job successful completion

### Prerequisites
* Oracle user login access and SQL access on the on-premise PeopleSoft database system
* SQL Access using ADMIN user on the PeopleSoft ADB-S database.


## Task 1: Source On-Premise PeopleSoft Objects count

1. Login as Oracle user and connect to the sqlplus prompt by entering the below SQL command

    ```
    <copy>[oracle@pscs92dmo-lnxdb-2 ~] sqlplus / as sysdba
    SQL*Plus: Release 19.0.0.0.0 - Production on Thu Apr 22 13:21:00 2021
    Version 19.10.0.0.0
    Copyright (c) 1982, 2020, Oracle. All rights reserved.
    Enter password:
    Last Successful login time: Thu Apr 22 2021 12:51:40 +00:00
    Connected to:
    Oracle Database 19c Enterprise Edition Release 19.0.0.0.0 - Production
    Version 19.5.0.0.0

    SQL>alter session set container=pspdb;
    Session altered

    SQL> col owner format a20;
    SQL> select owner, object_type, count(*) from all_objects where owner in ('PS','PEOPLE','SYSADM') group by owner, object_type order by 1,2; </copy>

    ```
    Output of the above command from on-premise Peoplesoft database is below

## Task 2: Peoplesoft Schema objects count on ADB-S

1. Login as root user to the source Peopleoft database system and connect to the ADB-S database and execute the below SQL commands to verify the count of Peoplesoft schema objects

    ```
    <copy>[oracle@pscs92dmo-lnxdb-2 ~] sqlplus admin@psadb_high
    SQL*Plus: Release 19.0.0.0.0 - Production on Thu Apr 22 13:21:00 2021
    Version 19.10.0.0.0
    Copyright (c) 1982, 2020, Oracle. All rights reserved.

    Oracle Database 19c Enterprise Edition Release 19.0.0.0.0 - Production
    Version 19.5.0.0.0

        
    SQL> col owner format a20;
    SQL> select owner, object_type, count(*) from all_objects where owner in ('PS','PEOPLE','SYSADM') group by owner, object_type order by 1,2; </copy>

    ```
    Output of the above command from an ADB-S Peoplesoft database is below
