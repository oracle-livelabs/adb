# Load Transactional Data on Blockchain Table


## Introduction

Blockchain tables are append-only tables in which only insert operations are allowed. Deleting rows is either prohibited or restricted based on time. Rows in a blockchain table are made tamper-resistant by special sequencing and chaining algorithms. Users can verify that rows have not been tampered. A hash value that is part of the row metadata is used to chain and validate rows.

In this Lab you will use Blockchain Tables to store transactional data to ensure data has not been any data tampering.

Estimated Lab Time: 15 minutes.

### Objectives

In this lab, you will:

* Create a Blockchain Table
* Load Data into Blockchain table
* Learn about Blockchain table characteristics
* Validate a Blockchain table


### Prerequisites

This lab assumes you have created the Autonomous Data Warehouse database in the previous lab.

## Task 1: Create Blockchain table

1. Before start the exercise you need to **Download the Data**. Download the **CSV dataset** from the following [LINK] (https://objectstorage.us-ashburn-1.oraclecloud.com/p/jyHA4nclWcTaekNIdpKPq3u2gsLb00v_1mmRKDIuOEsp--D6GJWS_tMrqGmb85R2/n/c4u04/b/livelabsfiles/o/labfiles/revenue.csv "download csv dataset"). 


2. Let's create the **Blockchain table**. We need to go back to **SQL** menu on the **Database Actions** section. If you are still connected as CNVG user, you can go to step number 9 from this lab and step. Otherwise, you can follow the following steps.


3. Let's go to our **Autonomous Data Warehouse**.

    ![Go to ADW](./images/go-to-adb.png)

4. Select our **MODERNDW** database.

    ![Choose ADW](./images/choose-adw.png)

5. Go to **Database Actions**.

    ![Choose DB ACtions](./images/go-to-actions.png)

6. We need to connect with the **CNVG** and not with the **ADMIN** user. Let's log out first.

    ![Log out](./images/sign-out.png)

7. Click on **Sign in**.

    ![Log ing](./images/sign-in.png)

8. Connect with the **CNVG** user we created before.

    - **User Name:** CNVG
        ```
        <copy>CNVG</copy>
        ```

    - **Password:** Password123##
        ```
        <copy>Password123##</copy>
        ```

    ![Use cnvg](./images/actions-cnvg.png)

9. Select **SQL**. Remember, **validate** we are the **CNVG** user and not the ADMIN user.

    ![Select SQL](./images/select-sql.png)

3. Copy the following **create table statement**, which contains the blockchain table:

    ```
        <copy> CREATE BLOCKCHAIN TABLE REVENUE
            (    "SHIPTO_ADDR_KEY" NUMBER, 
            "OFFICE_KEY" NUMBER, 
            "EMPL_KEY" NUMBER, 
            "PROD_KEY" NUMBER, 
            "ORDER_KEY" NUMBER, 
            "UNITS" NUMBER, 
            "DISCNT_VALUE" NUMBER, 
            "BILL_MTH_KEY" NUMBER, 
            "BILL_QTR_KEY" NUMBER, 
            "BILL_DAY_DT" TIMESTAMP (6), 
            "ORDER_DAY_DT" TIMESTAMP (6), 
            "PAID_DAY_DT" TIMESTAMP (6), 
            "DISCNT_RATE" NUMBER, 
            "ORDER_STATUS" VARCHAR2(64 BYTE) , 
            "CURRENCY" VARCHAR2(64 BYTE) , 
            "ORDER_TYPE" VARCHAR2(64 BYTE) , 
            "SHIP_DAY_DT" TIMESTAMP (6), 
            "COST_FIXED" NUMBER, 
            "COST_VARIABLE" NUMBER, 
            "SRC_ORDER_NUMBER" VARCHAR2(32767 BYTE) , 
            "ORDER_NUMBER" NUMBER, 
            "REVENUE" NUMBER, 
            "ORDER_DTIME2_TIMEZONE" VARCHAR2(64 BYTE) , 
            "AFFINITY_CARD" NUMBER, 
            "ALREADY_BAD_COMMENTS" NUMBER, 
            "CUST_KEY" VARCHAR2(64 BYTE) 
            )  
            NO DROP UNTIL 16 DAYS IDLE
            NO DELETE LOCKED
            HASHING USING "SHA2_512" VERSION "v1";
        </copy>
    ```

4. **Paste** it over SQL, and click on **Run**.

    Check that the **statement has being completed successfully**.

    ![Create table](./images/create-table.png)

## Task 2: Load data into Blockchain table

1. Let's **load the data**, select the **Data Load** section from the menu.

    ![Load Data](./images/select-load2.png)

2. We are going to **upload our local file**. Select **Local File** option and click **Next**.

    ![Define Local](./images/define-local.png)

3. Select our **revenue.csv** file.

    ![Select File](./images/select-file.png)

4. Once it is **selected**, we are going to **define** into which table we want to load. Click on the **Edit** button.

    ![Modify Load](./images/modify-load.png)

5. **Modify the table insert**. Once it is modified, you can click **Close**.

    - **Option:** Insert into table
    
    - **Name:** REVENUE

    ![Set Definition](./images/set-definition.png)

6. Now you can click on **Run** to **load the data into the blockchain table**.

    ![Load Data](./images/load-data.png)

    ![Run load](./images/run-load.png)

7. You should see **no error** when loading. Be sure you have the **green check tick** like in the picture below.

    ![Data loaded](./images/data-loaded.png)

## Task 3: Try to do data tampering

1. Now that we have the **data loaded**, let's go to **SQL** to run some queries.

    ![Back SQL](./images/back-sql.png)

2. Let's have a look into the **new revenue data**. You will see information about many transactions. **Run** the following statement:

    ```
        <copy> 
            select * from revenue
        </copy>
    ```

    ![Select Revenue](./images/select-revenue.png)

3. We can have a look to see **how many rows** do we have. **Run** the following statement:

    ```
        <copy> 
            select count(*)  from revenue
        </copy>
    ```
        
    ![Count Revenue](./images/count-revenue.png)

4. We can easily **identify how many Blockchain tables** we have in our schema. **Run** the following statement:

    ```
        <copy> 
            select * from user_blockchain_tables
        </copy>
    ```
        
    ![List Tables](./images/list-tables.png)

5. **Blockchain tables has some hidden columns**. They are used to implement sequencing of rows and verify that data is tamper-resistant. Hidden columns can only be displayed by explicitly including the column names in the query. **Run** the following statement:

    ```
        <copy> 
            SELECT table_name, internal_column_id, column_name, data_type, data_length 
            FROM user_tab_cols
            where table_name='REVENUE'
            ORDER BY internal_column_id;
        </copy>
    ```
        
    ![Hidden Columns](./images/hidden-columns.png)

6. Let's query that **hidden columns**. **Run** the following statement:

    ```
        <copy> 
           select order_key, cust_key,  ORABCTAB_INST_ID$,
            ORABCTAB_CHAIN_ID$, ORABCTAB_SEQ_NUM$,
            ORABCTAB_CREATION_TIME$, ORABCTAB_USER_NUMBER$,
            ORABCTAB_HASH$, ORABCTAB_SIGNATURE$, ORABCTAB_SIGNATURE_ALG$,
            ORABCTAB_SIGNATURE_CERT$ from revenue;
        </copy>
    ```

    ![Query Columns](./images/query-hidden.png)

7. Now that we have all the info about the Blockchain table, let's try to run an **update**. **Run** the following statement:

    ```
        <copy> 
           update revenue set order_key=1 where order_key=2;
        </copy>
    ```
    
    ![Update Table](./images/update-table.png)

    We have the following message: **ORA-05715: operation not allowed on the blockchain or immutable table**.

8. Now let's try to **drop** the table. **Run** the following statement:

    ```
        <copy> 
           drop table revenue;
        </copy>
    ```
    
    ![Drop Table](./images/drop-table.png)

    We have the following message: **ORA-05723: drop blockchain or immutable table REVENUE not allowed**.

## Task 4: Validate data

1. Oracle provides a **validation procedure to ensure that our data has not been tampered or modified**, breaking the blockchain table definition. **Run** the following statement:

    ```
        <copy> 
           declare
           total_rows number;
           verify_rows NUMBER;
        begin
            select count(*) into total_rows from revenue;
            dbms_blockchain_table.verify_rows('CNVG','REVENUE',number_of_rows_verified => verify_rows);
            dbms_output.put_line(' Total of Rows=' || total_rows || '  Verified Rows=' || verify_rows);
        end;
        </copy>
    ```

    Check that the **statement has being completed successfully**.

    ![Validate Table](./images/validate-table.png)

You can **proceed to the next lab.**
