5. Notice the tables generated by the DDL we created in the first lab. Copy and paste the following into the worksheet:

    ```
    <copy>
    SELECT * FROM WKSP_TWITTERLL.MODEL
    </copy>
    ```
    Select the **play** button to run the script

    ![worksheet for model](images/select-star-model.png)

6. Notice the output indexes the table by **Model ID.** We will analyze this data in the next labs: Data processing and Machine Learning.

7. Copy and paste the following into the worksheet:

    ```
    <copy>
    SELECT * FROM WKSP_TWITTERLL.PLACE
    </copy>
    ```
    Select the **play** button to run the script

    ![Output for PLACE table](images/place-output.png)

    Notice the indexed metadata from tweets. Here we have four tweets from Mexico and Canada.

8. Copy and paste the following into the worksheet:

    ```
    <copy>
    SELECT * FROM WKSP_TWITTERLL.TWEET
    </copy>
    ```
    Select the **play** button to run the script

    ![Output for TWEET table](images/tweet-output.png)

    Notice the tweets are indexed by retweets and likes also. This would be help for a quick glance at which tweets are most popular.

9. Copy and paste the following into the worksheet:

    ```
    <copy>
    SELECT * FROM WKSP_TWITTERLL.USERS
    </copy>
    ```
    Select the **play** button to run the script

    ![Output for USERS table](images/users-output.png)

    Notice the users are  indexed by followers and tweet counts, which is helpful to see what accounts are real and which are actually bots.

10. Notice all of the data that was extracted from Twitter. This will be helpful for analytics, which will be covered in the last lab **Explore APEX.**

You may now **proceed to the next lab.**
