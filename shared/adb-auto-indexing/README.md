# Oracle Database Auto Partitioning GitHub

Automatic partitioning in Autonomous Database analyzes your application workload and automatically applies partitioning to your tables and indexes to improve performance or to allow better management of large tables.

Finding appropriate partitioning strategies requires deep knowledge of the application workload and the data distribution. When you perform manual partitioning, you must analyze your workload and make choices about how to apply partitioning to tables and indexes to improve the performance of applications. Automatic partitioning enables Autonomous Database users to benefit from partitioning without performing manual schema and workload analysis.

Automatic partitioning uses a single-column partition key combined with single-level partitioning. Automatic partitioning does not support more complex partitioning strategies such as multi-column partitioned tables or composite partitioning as of today.
