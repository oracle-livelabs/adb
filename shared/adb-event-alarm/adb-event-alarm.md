# Set Event and Alarm Notifications for an Autonomous Database

## Introduction

> **Note:** the OCI Notifications service is not supported in the Livelabs hosted sandbox environment. If you are running this workshop in a LiveLabs sandbox, please view the steps in this lab to learn about setting event and alarm notifications. However, please do not attempt to perform the steps.

The Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) Notifications service broadcasts messages to distributed components through a publish-subscribe pattern, delivering secure, highly reliable, low latency and durable messages for applications hosted on OCI and externally.

The Notifications service enables you to set up communication channels for publishing messages using topics and subscriptions . When a message is published to a topic, the Notifications service sends the message to all of the topic's subscriptions.

This lab shows you how to define events and alarms with conditional rules that will generate email notifications when the state of an Autonomous Database changes or an alarm condition has been met.

**An event** is triggered for a lifecycle management (LCM) type operation performed in Oracle Cloud, such as creating a database, stopping a database, and so on.

**An alarm** is triggered over a resource utilization metric, such as a database's CPU utilization going over a certain percentage or Object Storage bucket going over a certain size limit.

Estimated Lab Time: 20 minutes

### Objectives

In this lab, you'll:

- Use the OCI Console to define a notification topic and subscribe to the topic.
- Create a rule for an Autonomous Database event that will trigger an email notification.
- Perform an activity that activates the rule and confirm that an email notification was sent. 
- Create and test an Autonomous Database alarm that will trigger an email notification.

## **PART 1 - Define an Event that Will Email a Notification When a Database Is Stopped**

OCI Notifications service enables you to set up communication channels for publishing messages using topics and subscriptions.

**Topic**: A communication channel for sending messages to the subscriptions in the topic.

**Subscription**: An endpoint for a topic. Published messages are sent to each subscription for a topic.

**Message**: The content that is published to a topic. Each message is delivered at least once per subscription.

In Tasks 1 through 7, you create a notification topic with an email subscription, then create a rule that triggers a message (email) when a database is stopped.

## Task 1: Sign in to OCI Console and Create a Notification Topic

> **Note:** Again, please note that the OCI Notifications service is not supported in the Livelabs hosted sandbox environment. If you are running this workshop in a LiveLabs sandbox, please view the steps in this lab to learn about setting event and alarm notifications. However, please do not attempt to perform the steps.

1. First, you will create a Notification topic. From OCI Services menu, click **Developer Services** -> **Notifications**

## Task 2: Create a Subscription to the Topic

Now that you have created a notification topic, create a subscription to that topic, so that you can receive email alerts when a condition changes. (You will create a rule with conditions in a following task.)

In this lab, you create an email subscription. Subscriptions can be defined to trigger emails or pager notifications (for on-call staff whose phones will be paged.)

1. Click the topic Name. Click **Create Subscription**.![ALT text is not available for this image](images/2569305855.png)

2. Fill out the dialog box:

    - **PROTOCOL**: Email
    - **EMAIL**: Provide your email id

3. Click **Create**.

  ![ALT text is not available for this image](images/2569305899.png)

4. The Subscription Details screen will be displayed with subscription status showing **Pending confirmation**.

  ![ALT text is not available for this image](images/2569305971.png)

## Task 3: Respond to the Verification Email

You will receive an email notification of your subscription. You will need to respond to the email's verification request.

1. Check the email account you specified and open the verification email. Click the **Confirm subscription** verification link for this subscription.

  ![ALT text is not available for this image](images/2569306086.png)

2. A browser tab will open, confirming that you have subscribed your email account to the topic: Database-Notification.

  ![ALT text is not available for this image](images/2587885600.png)

## Task 4: Verify that Subscription Status Has Changed from Pending to Active

Your verification of the email will change the subscription status from pending to active.

1. Switch back to OCI console window and verify the subscription status changed to **Active**. You may need to refresh your browser.

  ![ALT text is not available for this image](images/2587885707.png)

2. You are now subscribed to a Notification topic. Next you will define an event with conditions that, when met, will publish messages to this Notification topic.

## Task 5: Define an Event with Rules that Will Publish Messages

Let's define an event that triggers an email notification when an Autonomous Database is stopped.

1. From OCI Services menu, click **Observability & Management >** **Rules**.

  ![ALT text is not available for this image](images/2587885780.png)

2. Click **Create Rule**.

  ![ALT text is not available for this image](images/2587885820.png)

3. Fill out the dialog box:

    - **DISPLAY NAME** : Provide a name, such as the event type that you will be choosing; in this lab, the event type will be Autonomous Database - Stop End.
    - **DESCRIPTION** : Provide a description.

  Under **Rule Conditions**

    - **Condition:** Event Type
    - **SERVICE NAME**: Database
    - **EVENT TYPE** : Choose **Autonomous Database - Stop End** from the drop down menu. 

  Under **Actions**

    - **ACTION TYPE**: Notifications
    - **NOTIFICATIONS COMPARTMENT**: Choose your compartment.
    - **TOPIC**: Choose the topic created earlier, **Database-Notification**.

4. Click **Create Rule**. 

  ![ALT text is not available for this image](images/2587886335.png)

You have configured a Notification service and tied an event to it with a specific compartment. When a database is shut down, an email notification will be sent to the email address specified.

## Task 6: Trigger the Event

Now shut down the Autonomous Database to trigger the notification email.

1. Navigate to your Autonomous Database's Details page. From the **More Actions** drop-down menu, select **Stop**.

- **VALUE**: Specify the value of the condition threshold. In this lab example, specify **30** so that the alarm will trigger if CPU utilization exceeds 30 percent..
- **TRIGGER DELAY MINUTES**: Specify the number of minutes that the condition must be maintained before the alarm is in a firing state. In this lab example, specify **1** minute.

  ![ALT text is not available for this image](images/notifications.png)

  Under **Notifications**

- **DESTINATION SERVICE:** Select **Notifications Service**
- **COMPARTMENT**: Select your compartment.
- **TOPIC**: Select the topic you defined earlier in Part 1 > Task 1 of this lab. Click **Save alarm**.

  ![ALT text is not available for this image](images/2619005285.png)

## Task 9: Re-run the Procedure in the Auto Scaling Lab to Create a CPU Utilization that Triggers the Alarm

1. Return to this workshop's Auto Scaling lab.  
2. In Part 2 of that lab, perform Task 5. Run the `**test_proc**` procedure concurrently in 3 SQL Developer Web query worksheet instances, which should result in CPU utilization greater than the 30% specified as the triggering level in the alarm. 

## Task 10: Verify that an Email Notification Was Sent

Check the email account you specified to verify that a notification email was sent.

1. Go to the specified email account and verify that a notification of the CPU utilization has been sent.
