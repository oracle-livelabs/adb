# Introduction

## About this Workshop

In this workshop, you will learn how to use **Autonomous Database Select AI (Select AI)** to query your data using natural language; you don't need prior knowledge of the data structure or how that data is accessed. Next, you'll use those capabilities in a voice-enabled APEX app that enables you to get answers to your questions from your desktop or mobile device.

### What is Natural Language?

Natural language processing is the ability of a computer application to understand human language as it is spoken and written. It is a component of artificial intelligence (AI).

### What is Generative AI?

Generative AI enables users to quickly generate new content based on a variety of inputs. Inputs and outputs to these models can include text, images, sounds, animation, 3D models, and other types of data.

### Objectives

In this workshop, you will:
* Configure your Autonomous Database to leverage a generative AI model for querying data using natural language
* Use AI SQL to query data using natural language
* Learn about PL/SQL APIs that help integrate AI with your application
* Use an APEX app that enables you chat with your data in your own language

### Oracle MovieStream Business Scenario
The workshop's business scenario is based on Oracle MovieStream - a fictitious movie streaming service that is similar to services to which you currently subscribe. You'll be able to ask questions about movies, customers who watch movies, and the movies they decide to watch.

You may now proceed to the next lab.
