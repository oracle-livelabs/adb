# Introduction

## About this Workshop

In this workshop, you will learn how to use Autonomous Database AI SQL to query your data using natural language; no knowledge of the structure of the data or how that data is access is required. Then, you'll use those capabilities in a voice-enabled APEX app that lets you get answers to your questions from your desktop or mobile device.


### Objectives
In this workshop, you will:
* Configure your Autonomous Database to leverage a generative AI model for querying data using natural language
* Use AI SQL to query data using natural language
* Learn about PLSQL APIs that help integrate AI with your application
* Use an APEX app that lets you chat with your data in your own language


### Oracle MovieStream Business Scenario
The workshop's business scenario is based on Oracle MovieStream - a fictitious movie streaming service that is similar to services that you currently subscribe to. You'll be able to ask questions about movies, customers who watch movies and the movies they decide to watch.
