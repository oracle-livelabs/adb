# Audit database activity

## Introduction

Audit resources for Oracle Data Safe (audit profiles, audit policies, and audit trails) are automatically created for all registered target databases. 

In this lab, you use the auditing wizard to enable alert and audit policies on your target database, start audit data collection in Oracle Data Safe, and configure the retention periods for your audit data. You then perform activity on your target database and review the alerts and audit events generated in Oracle Data Safe.

Estimated Lab Time: 10 minutes

### Objectives

In this lab, you will:

- Configure auditing and alerts for your target database
- Perform activities on your target database to generate audit data
- Review alerts in Oracle Data Safe
- Review audit events in Oracle Data Safe


### Prerequisites

This lab assumes you have:

- Obtained an Oracle Cloud account
- Signed in to the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Console
- Prepared your environment for this workshop
- Registered your target database with Oracle Data Safe

    ![Activity Auditing wizard - Audit trails](images/activity-auditing-wizard-audit-trails.png "Activity Auditing wizard - Audit Trails")

7. For **Audit profile**, select the following configuration, and then click **Next**.

    - Audit data online retention months = `12`
    - Audit data offline retention months = `0`
    - This will override the global retention settings, please confirm = `Yes`
    - Paid usage = not selected

    ![Activity Auditing wizard - Audit profile](images/activity-auditing-wizard-audit-profile.png "Activity Auditing wizard - Audit profile")

    - Each regional Oracle Data Safe service in a tenancy has global settings for paid usage, online retention period, and archive retention period.
    - Global settings are applied to all target databases unless their audit profiles override them.
    - All initial audit profile settings for your target database are inherited from the global settings for Oracle Data Safe.
    - By default, paid usage is not enabled for all target databases. You cannot enable paid usage for a free trial account.

8. For **Review and submit**, review the configuration, and click **Submit** if everything is correct.

    ![Activity Auditing wizard - Review and submit](images/activity-auditing-wizard-review-submit.png "Activity Auditing wizard - Review and submit")

9. For **Audit configuration progress**, wait until the alert and audit policies are provisioned and the audit trail is started. 
    
    ![Activity Auditing wizard - Audit configuration progress](images/activity-auditing-wizard-audit-configuration-progress.png "Activity Auditing wizard - Audit configuration progress")
    
10. Click **Close**.

## Task 2: Perform Activities on your Target Database to Generate Audit Data

In this task, you perform activities on your target database in Database Actions to generate some audit data. First, purposely try to log in as the `ADMIN` user with incorrect passwords. Then, you will sign in as the `ADMIN` user and create a new user account.

1. Return to the SQL worksheet in Database Actions.

2. Sign out of Database Actions. The **Sign-in** page is displayed.

3. In the **Username** field, enter `ADMIN`.

4. In the **Password** field, enter an incorrect password twice, and then click **Sign in**. An **Invalid credentials** message is displayed after each invalid sign in attempt.

    ![Invalid database password message](images/invalid-database-password.png =60%x*)

5. Enter the correct password, and click **Sign in**.

6. The SQL Worksheet is displayed. If not, click the **Development** > **SQL** tabs. Next, click **SQL**.

7. Clear the worksheet (click the **Clear** icon), and then paste the following SQL script. Replace `your-password` with a password of your choice. _The password must be between 12 and 30 characters long and must include at least one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, and one numeric character. It cannot contain your username or the double quote (") character_.

    ```
    <copy>DROP USER malfoy CASCADE;
    CREATE USER malfoy IDENTIFIED BY your-password;
    GRANT PDB_DBA TO malfoy;
    </copy>
    ```

8. Click the **Run Script** icon on the toolbar.

9. In the **Script Output** tab, verify that the `MALFOY` user was successfully dropped and then recreated.

    ![Drop and create user](images/drop-create-user.png " ")

10. Return to the browser tab for **Oracle Data Safe** and wait a couple of minutes for Oracle Data Safe to produce the alerts.

## Task 3: Review Alerts in Oracle Data Safe

1. In the **Security center** section on the left, click **Alerts**.

    ![Click Alerts](images/click-alerts.png " ")

2. In the **Filters** section on the left, select your target database.

    ![Select Target database](images/select-target-database.png =45%x*)

3. Review the alerts dashboard.

    - The **Alerts summary** chart compares the number of critical, high, and medium alerts.
    - The **Open alerts** chart shows that there are open alerts on the current day.
    - The **Top 10 alert policies by volume** chart shows you the number of alerts for the alert policies you just configured.
    - The **Alerts summary** tab shows the number of critical, high, and medium alerts along with target database counts. It also shows you the total number of alerts and target databases. 
    - The **Targets summary** tab shows the number of open, critical, high, and medium alerts.

        ![Alerts dashboard charts](images/alerts-dashboard-charts.png "Alerts dashboard charts")
    
        ![Targets summary tab](images/alerts-dashboard-targets-summary-tab.png "Targets summary tab")


4. In the **Related resources** section, click **Reports**.

5. In the **Report name** column on the right, click the **All alerts** report and review it.

    ![All Alerts report](images/all-alerts-report.png " ")

    - The report is automatically filtered to show you all alerts for all target databases in the selected compartment for the past one week. To create filters, you can use the **+ Another filter** button or the **SCIM query builder**. 
    - You can view several totals, including the total number of target databases; total number of open and closed alerts, the total number of critical, high, medium, and low alerts; and the total number of alerts. You can click the **Targets** total to view the list of target databases. You can click the other totals to toggle a filter on the list of alerts.
    - At the bottom of the report, you can view the list of alerts. By default, the table shows you the alert name, alert status, alert severity, target databases on which the audited event occurred, when the alert was created, and the alert policy rule name.
    - You have options to create a PDF or XLS report, create a custom report, schedule a custom report, open and close alerts, and specify which table columns you want displayed on the page.

        ![All alerts report top](images/all-alerts-report-full.png " ")
    
## Task 4: Review Audit Events in Oracle Data Safe

1. In the **Security center** section, click **Activity auditing**.

2. In the **Filters** section, select your target database from the **Target databases** drop-down list. 

3. On the **Events summary** tab, click one of the event categories, for example, **Login failures by admin** to view more detail.

    ![Events tab](images/events-tab.png " ")
    
   
    ![Login failures report - top](images/login-failures.png " ")

You may now **proceed to the next lab**.
