# Use the Select AI Demo Application

## Introduction

As you can see from the previous labs, **Select AI** makes it easy to build apps that take advantage of natural language queries. In this lab, you'll experiment with a few. When you ran the scripts to set up your environment, The Select AI APEX demo application was also installed. The app is probably the easiest way to get answers about your business and general internet content. Simply ask a question! You can then explore the result, get an understanding of the generated SQL (and even update it if you like) and manage conversations.

>**Note:** Refer to lab 3 to review what you learned about creating profiles to specify what LLM provider and database schema/tables to use when answering your questions in the app.

Estimated Time: 10 minutes.

Watch the video below for a detailed walk-through of using the Oracle APEX-based ChatDB demo application and the Select AI feature.

### Objectives

In this lab, you will:
* As the `moviestream` user, access the **Select AI demo** application using the URL that you saved in a text editor file in **Lab 1 > Task 2 > Step 6**. If you didn't save the URL, refer to **Lab 1 > Task 2** to find it using the **Outputs** link in the **Resources** section on the **Job details** page.
* Ask natural questions with the **Select AI demo** application.

### Prerequisites
- This lab requires the completion of all the preceding labs in the **Contents** menu on the left.

## Task 1: Access the Select AI Demo Application

1. Copy the **Select AI demo** application URL that you saved in a text editor.

    ![Copy the URL value](./images/demo-credentials-file.png =65%x*)

    Paste the URL in a new tab in your Web browser, and then click **[ENTER]**. In the **ChatDB** page, enter the username (`moviestream`) and password that you saved in your text editor file, and then click **Sign In**.

    ![Enter ChatDB credentials](./images/ai-select-credentials.png =70%x*)

2. On the **ChatDB** page, select a profile that you want to use from the **Service** drop-down list. In this workshop, select the **`OPENAI_GPT35`** profile that was created in the **Create credential and AI profile** paragraph in the notebook that you imported in the **Lab 3**.

    ![Select AI profile](./images/select-profile.png =70%x*)

    The ChatDB application is displayed. You are now ready to ask questions at the **Ask a question** prompt!

## Task 2: Ask Natural Language and Database Questions Using the Application

You can use this application to ask the following types of questions:

- **Ask the Internet Using your LLM Provider:**
_Uncheck the **Ask Database** checkbox_ to ask general free form questions (internet-based) about anything such as _How do you make french toast?_. This question will go to the LLM Provider that you selected when you created the profile and returns the answer.

  ![Ask the internet](./images/ask-internet.png =70%x*)

- **Ask your Database :**
_Select the **Ask Database** checkbox_ to ask questions about your business data based on the user and tables in the database that you specified when you created the profile.

  ![Ask the database](./images/ask-database.png =70%x*)

  <!---
  Where do you specify what LLM provider and database schema/tables to use when answering your questions? When you create the profile using **`DBMS_CLOUD_AI.CREATE_PROFILE`** PL/SQL procedure, you specify the LLM provider, the credential, the schema, and the tables to use to answer your natural language questions on general data or your business data that is stored in your database.

  ![Create profile diagram](./images/create-profile-diagram.png " ")
--->

Let's experiment a bit with both general data from the `internet` and also from the `moviestream` tables in the database.

1. Let's find out how to make french toast. Enter your question using a free form format in the **Ask a Question** text box, and make sure that the **Ask Database** checkbox is not checked since this is a general internet question that will be handled by your LLM provider. Next, click the **Run** icon, or press **[ENTER]**.

    >**Note:** You can type your own natural language question. You don't have to use the exact question that we show in our examples.

    ![How to make french toast question](./images/french-toast-question.png =70%x*)

    A French toast recipe is displayed.

   ![How to make french toast answer](./images/french-toast-answer.png =70%x*)

2. Let's find out the top 10 streamed movies in the moviestream company. Enter your question using a free form format in the **Ask a Question** text box, and select the **Ask Database** checkbox since this is a question about the moviestream data. Next, press **[ENTER]**.

    ![Top 10 streamed movies](./images/top-10-movies.png =70%x*)

    The top 10 streamed movies are displayed in descending order.

    ![Top 10 streamed movies result](./images/top-10-movies-result.png =70%x*)

3. Click the **Explain** link to view and explain the SQL query behind this natural language question.

  ![View and explain query](./images/explain-query-1.png =70%x*)

  When you finish, click the **Close SQL** icon (left arrow) to return to the Home page. Click the **Explore** link to display the **Explore** page.

  ![The Explore page](./images/explore-page.png =70%x*)

4. Click the **Actions** drop-down list to perform several tasks on the generated data such as sorting, downloading, formatting, charting and much more. For details on using the actions tasks, see the embedded video in the Introduction section of this lab. Click the **Close SQL** icon (left arrow) to return to the Home page.

  >**Note:** _LLMs are remarkable at inferring intent from the human language and they are getting better all the time; however, they are not perfect! It is very important to verify the results._

You may now proceed to the next lab.
