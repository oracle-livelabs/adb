# Load Data from Object Storage Public Buckets

## Introduction

In this lab, you will load and link data from the MovieStream data lake on [Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Object Storage](https://www.oracle.com/cloud/storage/object-storage.html) into an Oracle Autonomous Database instance in preparation for exploration and analysis.

You can load data into your Autonomous Database (either Oracle Autonomous Data Warehouse or Oracle Autonomous Transaction Processing) using the built-in tools as in this lab, or you can use other Oracle and third party data integration tools. With the built-in tools, you can load data:

+ from files in your local device
+ from tables in remote databases
+ from files stored in cloud-based object storage (Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Object Storage, Amazon S3, Microsoft Azure Blob Storage, Google Cloud Storage)

You can also leave data in place in cloud object storage, and link to it from your Autonomous Database.

> **Note:** While this lab uses Oracle Autonomous Data Warehouse, the steps are identical for loading data into an Oracle Autonomous Transaction Processing database.

This workshop explores several methods for loading data into an Oracle Autonomous Database. In this first data loading lab, we practice loading data from public object storage buckets.

Estimated Time: 10 minutes

Watch the video below for a quick walk-through of the lab.

### Objectives

In this lab, you will:
* Navigate to the Data Load utility of Oracle Autonomous Database Data Tools
* Learn how to create tables and load data from public object storage buckets using Data Tools built-in to Oracle Autonomous Database

### Prerequisites

- This lab requires completion of the lab **Provision an Autonomous Database**, in the Contents menu on the left.

## Task 1: Navigate to Database Actions and open the Data Load utility

[](include:adb-goto-data-load-utility.md)

## Task 2: Create tables and load data from files in public Object Storage buckets using Database Actions tools

This step will create and load the following tables into Autonomous Database: genre, customer_contact, custsales and pizza\_locations.

Please [proceed to the next lab](#next).
