# Use Oracle Machine Learning and AutoML UI to predict customer churn

## Introduction

#### Video preview

<!--[](youtube:iK2T6iKaYqQ)-->

Analyzing past performance lets you know customers who have already been lost. Let's get in front of this problem and predict those that are at risk using in database analytics.

In this lab, you will use Oracle Machine Learning (OML) in Autonomous Database to identify customers with a higher likelihood of churning from **Oracle MovieStream** streaming services. You will first use OML AutoML UI to create a customer churn model. Then, you will use OML Notebooks to score customers using both SQL and Python.

Estimated Time: 30 minutes

Watch the video below for a quick walk-through of the lab.

## Task 1: Navigate to Oracle Machine Learning UI
</if>

  Before we continue, let's see a brief explanation on how we should define **CHURN** in our business

- Defining customer churn for MovieStream
    To understand customer behavior, we need to look at both geo-demographic information and transactional patterns. For transactional data, we need to summarize customers' transactions by month for each type of transaction that we would like to explore. This type of summarization is required because machine learning algorithms need a single input row per customer, with each attribute reflected in a table column.

    A Data Engineer and a Data Scientist worked together to process and transform the data that exists in the **`CUSTSALES`** Oracle Database table. This table contains historical customer transactions for every movie streamed, including payment and discounts, and can help us identify customer preferences and usage of the service. To aggregate the data, with *one customer per row* (which is a data layout required by Machine Learning), they worked with the *date* information of the transactions to determine the customer behavior over time.

    Defining what *customer churn* means can be very complex. For our example, the agreement between the business team and the data scientist was:
    - A customer has "churned" if they had 1) *zero movie streams in the last available month of data* and 2) streamed movies every month during 13 months before a *buffer* month (detailed below).
    - In contrast to churners, "non-churners" are customers who have *streamed movies for 13 consecutive months including the last available month of data*.

    The following diagram shows the process we will use, including a *buffer* month that represents the time needed to be able to *act* on the knowledge that a customer is about to leave. Predicting the *probability that a customer is going to leave exactly right now* does not help preparing a customer retention campaign, since there is a lot of processing involved in updating customer data at the end of a day before one can do scoring, excluding customers that have a *DO NOT CONTACT* exception. Also, processing offers and other processes in sync with all other divisions of the enterprise will always take time.  

    ![Diagram of the Data on ML Churn Process](images/oml-customer-churn-concepts.png " ")

    In addition, *a customer churning today probably made that decision a while ago*. This means that our machine learning model needs to be able to detect any change in behavior from at least a month ago. This is the reason for the buffer of 1 month in the process.

1. From the Database Actions Launchpad, click the **Development** tab, and then click the **Machine Learning** tab.

    ![Go to ML UI](images/click-machine-learning.png " ")

<if type="ocw24sandbox">
1. We will access Oracle Machine Learning UI from the LiveLabs Instructions Login Info.  
   
    If you have not done so yet, make sure to click on *Launch Workshop* under *My Reservations*.

    ![Click on Launch Workshop](images/click-launch-workshop-myreserv.png " ")

    Click on *View Login Info* (1).  In the window that opens, click on *Copy value* for the `Database User Password` (2) and then click on the link for the *OML UI* (3).

    ![Click View Login Info and OML UI](images/click-view-login-info-omlui.png " ")

    You will be taken to the Login page for Oracle Machine Learning UI.
</if>


2. On the **Sign In** page, enter your username, **`OMLUSER`**, and the password that you chose.

<if type="ocw24sandbox">
    Remember to paste the Password you just copied, which is AAbbcc123456. 
</if>

    ![Oracle Machine Learning Notebooks sign-in page](images/oml-login-page.png " ")

3. The Oracle Machine Learning Home page is displayed. You can use this page to access tutorials, create models and notebooks, and more. We'll now create a new machine learning model using the **AutoML UI**. In the **Quick Actions** section, click **AutoML**.

    ![Churn AutoML Step 1 home menu](images/oml-churn-automl-home-menu.png " ")

    The **AutoML Experiments** page is displayed.

## Task 4: Create a new AutoML Experiment

<if type="ocw24sandbox">
## Task 2: Create a new AutoML Experiment
</if>

1. Create a new AutoML Experiment. An AutoML Experiment will generate a machine learning model. Click **+ Create**.

    ![Churn AutoML Step 2 main menu](images/click-create-experiment.png " ")

2. Enter a name for the new experiment and an optional description.  Next, click **Data Source** search icon (magnifying glass) to select the experiment's data source.

    ![Churn AutoML Step 2 open data source](images/click-data-source.png " ")

    Previously, we prepared the `MOVIESTREAM_CHURN` table which contains numerous attributes that should be helpful in predicting churn. 

    In the **Select Table** dialog box, make sure the `OMLUSER` schema is selected. In the **Table** section, select the `MOVIESTREAM_CHURN` table, and then click **OK**.

    ![Churn AutoML Step 2 select data source](images/oml-churn-automl-select-data.png " ")

    The **Create Experiment** page is re-displayed. 

    ![Churn AutoML Step 2 after loaded data](images/create-experiment-redisplayed.png " ")


4. Scroll down the page to the **Features** section. A list of the attributes available in the table is displayed. 

    >**Note:** Use the **scroll bar** next to the **`Std Dev`** statistics column to see the entire list. 

    ![Churn AutoML Step 2 features list](images/features-list.png " ")

5. Define the Prediction Target, Case ID, and Experiment Settings. Scroll up the page to the **Predict** drop-down list. Select the `IS_CHURNER` target attribute.

    ![Churn AutoML Step 3 target search](images/predict-selection.png =65%x*)

6. Define the **Case ID**. Click the drop-down list and select `CUST_ID` as the unique customer identifier.

    ![Churn AutoML Step 3 target selection](images/click-case-id.png =65%x*)

    On the left side, just under **Data Source**, you'll find that **Classification** is the selected **Prediction Type**. This is selected because AutoML detected that our **Predict** column, or `TARGET` attribute, has only two distinct values and therefore is a binary classification problem. The other prediction type, **Regression**, is not appropriate for our problem.

6.  Expand the **Additional Settings** section to customize processing. The default values for **Maximum Top Models** is **5**, but we will reduce that to **3** in order to make processing a bit faster for this workshop. Also, increase the **Database Service Level** to **HIGH**. Read more about Service Levels with OML AutoML UI in [this Blog Post](https://blogs.oracle.com/machinelearning/oml-automl-ui-4-things-you-can-do-that-affect-performance).

    ![Churn AutoML Step 3 additional settings](images/additional-settings.png =65%x*)

    We are going to leave the **Algorithms** selections as is, which means that OML AutoML will try each of these algorithms to find the best one for our situation.  The ability to select which algorithms to use is useful in case a specific Industry Regulator or business requirement dictates that a certain algorithm cannot be used.
    
    ![Churn AutoML Step 3 additional settings algorithms](images/algorithms.png =65%x*)

    Scroll down to the **Features** list. Let's exclude the customer names (First and Last) from the input attributes, as it does not make business sense to use those in this case.  We do not expect that the name to have an impact on the customer's likelihood to churn.

    Start by typing `Name` in the search box, and then **uncheck** the two checkboxes.
    ![Churn AutoML Step 3 additional settings name](images/additional-settings-name.png =70%x*)


    We are now ready to start the Experiment.

## Task 5: Run the Experiment and explore the results.

<if type="ocw24sandbox">
## Task 3: Run the Experiment and explore the results.
</if>

1. Start the Experiment. Click the **Start** drop-down list, and then select **Faster Results**. This selection speeds processing as OML AutoML UI will search for models on a reduced hyperparameter search space.

    ![Churn AutoML Task 2 Step 1 start experiment](images/start-experiment.png " ")

    This **Experiment** should complete on a **Classification** task using **Balanced Accuracy** as the metric, and using **Maximum Top Models of 3** in about **2 or 3 minutes**.

    > **NOTE:** If you choose different settings for your own Experiment, a larger number of models, or even run it at **Best Accuracy** instead of **Faster Results**, a longer running time might be required, and a different "best" algorithm might be chosen. In that case, your results might differ slightly from the screens below, but will still be valid and correct based on your settings.

    You will see a floating **Progress** indicator while the **Experiment** is running. The progress indicator shows the status of each of the Experiment's steps and an approximate time that it has been running.

    ![Status running](images/status-running.png =55%x*)

    The performance of OML AutoML UI is impacted by your Autonomous Database configuration. As explained in [this blog post](https://blogs.oracle.com/machinelearning/oml-automl-ui-4-things-you-can-do-that-affect-performance), several components may affect the performance, including the base number of Autonomous Database CPUs and whether or not auto scaling has been enabled.

2. Check the results.
   Once the process completes, you will note that the **Running** status on the top right changes to **Completed**. The **Balanced Accuracy** chart will show the increased accuracy over time as the models were tested, and the **Leader Board** will present the different algorithms that were chosen, and their respective **Model Names**.

    In the following screen we can see that the top 3 algorithms chosen were a **Random Forest**, a **Decision Tree** and a **Support Vector Machine**. By default they receive randomly generated unique **Model Names**.

    ![Churn AutoML Task 2 Step 3 completed experiment](images/oml-churn-automl-completed-experiment.png " ")

    After an **Experiment** run is completed, the **Features** grid displays an additional column **Importance**. This feature importance indicates the overall level of sensitivity of prediction to a particular feature. Hover your cursor over the graph to view the value of importance. The value is always depicted in the range 0 to 1, with values closer to 1 being more important.

    Scroll down to see the **Features** section. You will also note a **Search** box at the top right of this section, which is important given that there are 56 features (58 minus the ID and Target).

    In this **Experiment**, the attributes with the highest **overall importance** are:  `AGE` (customer age), `GENDER` (customer gender), `AVG_NTRANS_M3_5` (average number of transactions in the previous quarter), `CREDIT_BALANCE`, `YRS_RESIDENCE` (how many years the customer has lived in the same address), `GENRE_WAR` (how many movies of Genre War has the customer watched in the last year),  `GENRE_THRILLER`, `EDUCATION` (customer level of education) and `GENRE_FAMILY`.

    ![Churn AutoML Task 2 Step 3 features importance](images/oml-churn-automl-completed-features.png " ")

    > **Note:** this importance value is **not** related to any particular model, but it shows an overall value to give us an idea of potentially which attributes would be important.

    
3. Scroll up to the **Leader Board** section, you can click the **Random Forest** unique model name to open the diagnostics. Click on the Decision Tree **Model Name** link in blue.

    > **NOTE**: The exact random model name is unique to your model, with the two first characters representing the algorithm, so when you run this the name will be different than the **`RF_F4138CA9E7`** shown in the following screen capture.

    ![Churn AutoML Task 2 Step 4 Leader Board select model](images/leader-model.png " ")

    A new floating window opens, showing the **Prediction Impacts** tab sorted from larger to smaller. This time the attributes are listed in the order of impact that they have on this specific model in its formulation to predict churn.

    ![Churn AutoML Task 2 Step 4 Prediction Impacts](images/prediction-impacts.png " ")

    In this model, the most important features include geo-demographic attributes like `AGE`, `GENDER` and `EDUCATION`, as well as  behavioral attributes like `GENRE_THRILLER`, `AVG_NTRANS_M3_5` (average number of transactions in the previous quarter) and others with some lesser impact.

    After reviewing the impacts, click the **Confusion Matrix** tab to visualize the result of the assessment of the model on a **Test Set** of data chosen by AutoML for this test.

    ![Churn AutoML Task 2 Step 4 Confusion Matrix](images/click-confusion-matrix.png " ")

    >**Note:** The original Dataset contains 50% of Churners and 50% of a selection of the Non-churners.

    In the **Confusion Matrix** we can see that, in the **Test Set** this particular Random Forest model was able to correctly identify __93.03%__ of the future customer behaviors (the green diagonals, 64.81% + 28.22%).  

    The model incorrectly thought that __5.92%__ of the test dataset were going to churn (Predicted: 1), but they actually did not (Actual: 0).  This is actually not that bad for marketing purposes, since we would be sending offers to these customers when they might be staying with us anyway.

    The model also thought that __1.05%__ of the customers would not churn (Predict: 0) but they actually did (Actual: 1).  This type of error is more dangerous in churn management, since your model is not capable of identifying these customers as churners when they indeed would have been, and should be monitored over time.

## Task 6: Prepare the model for scoring and deployment

<if type="ocw24sandbox">
## Task 4: Prepare the model for scoring and deployment
</if>

 In preparation for scoring via SQL, we will want to rename the model, from the original randomly assigned name to something you can relate to your project.

1. We will **Rename** the model, which will allows us to run the scoring via SQL later. In the **Leader Board** section, with the model row selected (indicated by a light blue highlight in the row), click **Rename**.

    ![Click Rename](images/click-rename.png " ")  

    Rename the model to **`CHURN_PRED`**, and then click **OK**.

    ![Churn AutoML Task 3 Step 1 Leader Board Rename model](images/leader-rename.png " ")  

    The new name should appear in the **Leader Board** in a few seconds.

    ![Churn AutoML Task 3 Step 1 Leader Board Rename new name](images/rename-new-name.png " ")

    Now we are ready for scoring customers using SQL by using that model name.

## Task 7: Score customers with Python and SQL using the model

<if type="ocw24sandbox">
## Task 5: Score customers with Python and SQL using the model
</if>

 You can import a notebook from a local disk or from a remote location if you provide the URL. A notebook named **`Scoring Customers with Churn Model.dsnb`** contains all the steps for scoring data with Python and SQL using the **`CHURN_PRED`** model that was just created. In this task, you will first download the **Scoring Customers with Churn Model** OML notebook to your local machine, and then import this notebook into OML.

1. Click the button below to download the __`Scoring Customers with Churn Model.dsnb`__ OML notebook file to your computer:

    <a href="files/Scoring Customers with Churn Model.dsnb" class="tryit-button" style="background-color:maroon">Download notebook</a>

2. Click the Navigation menu on the upper left of the screen, and then select **Notebooks**.

    ![Oracle Machine Learning Notebooks menu](images/go-back-to-notebooks.png " ")

    The **Notebooks** page is displayed.

3. Click **Import** and navigate to the folder where you downloaded the **`Scoring_customers_with_Churn_Model.json`** file, and then click **Open** in the **Open** dialog box (on a MS-Windows machine). 

    ![Churn AutoML Task 3 Step 3 Scoring Notebook import](images/click-import.png " ")

    The **`Scoring customers with Churn Model`** is displayed in the list of Notebooks.

    ![The notebook is imported](images/notebook-imported.png " ")

4. Click the notebook name to open it.

    You will see that the notebook server starts and loads the notebook. You should see the beginning of the notebook, as shown below.

    > **Note:** You might be asked to click __Allow Run__ in the paragraphs that contain MarkDown code.  It is safe to do so in this case.

    ![Churn AutoML Task 3 Step 3 Scoring Notebook first screen](images/notebook-displayed.png " ")

5. We will follow the notes and instructions in the notebook, but before we do, and to make sure the entire environment is ready, we will run the entire notebook. Click the **Run Paragraphs** icon at the top of the screen next to the notebook name. In the **Run all paragraphs?** dialog box, click **Confirm**.

    ![Churn AutoML Task 3 Step 3 Scoring Notebook Run All option](images/notebook-run-all.png " ")

    The entire run is expected to take around 10 seconds, depending on the resources available.

    ![Churn AutoML Task 3 Step 3 Scoring Notebook ready](images/oml-churn-automl-notebook-after-run.png " ")

    > **Note:** Looking at the bottom right on each paragraph you will see how long ago it was run the last time.  Confirm that it says _a few minutes ago_ or _a few seconds ago_

6. In Python load the Random Forest model and create a new TABLE
   
    Scrolling down the Notebook body, the first large section with code is using __Python__ to create proxy connections to the dataset **`MOVIESTREAM_DATA`**, to the Random Forest model, and then using the _predict_ function to request the Database to score the dataset, generating an **Inference** for the future customer likelihood to Churn.
    
    ![Churn AutoML Task 3 Step 3 Scoring Notebook Python 1](images/oml-churn-automl-notebook-python.png " ")

    The second section of the __Python__ code is organizing the columns and reordering them to generate the expected **Probability to Churn** and whether a customer **Will Churn** (which in this case is '1' whenever the probability is over 50%, or '0' otherwise).  In addition to that the usage of the _.materialize()_ function is making the Database write a permanent table from the original temporary one created by the prediction process, so others in the team can query that table.

    ![Churn AutoML Task 3 Step 3 Scoring Notebook Python 2](images/oml-churn-automl-notebook-python2.png " ")

7. Oracle Machine Learning can generate Prediction Details dynamically

    This feature allows us to get, for every customer scored, the top "N" `Reasons Why` the model predicted that the customer is a `0` (non-Churner) or `1` (Churner).

    For example, the first row indicates that CUST_ID = 1031800 was predicted to be a *Non-Churner* (`0`) and the most important Features that were the reason for such prediction are:
    - Feature 1: AGE = 57 with relative weight of 4.142
    - Feature 2: `AVG_NTRANS_M3_5` = 5.67 with relative weight of 0.168
    - Feature 3: GENRE_WAR = 1
    And you can continue looking at the other Features by scrolling to the right.

    This means that the most important reasons why this person was identified as a *Non-Churner* by the model have to do with their age, their average number of transactions in the last quarter, the number of movies of the genre WAR, among others.

     ![Churn AutoML Task 3 Step 3 Scoring Notebook Python 3](images/oml-churn-automl-notebook-python3.png " ")
   
    
7. In SQL let's review the table created by Python and run a dynamic scoring with the model
   
    If we scroll down to the **SQL** section, we see basically two main steps. There is one paragraph that deletes a table named `LATEST_POTENTIAL_CHURNERS` if it exists (in case we wanted to experiment later with SQL).
    
    In the first paragraph, we can see that we can query the table that was `materialized` via the Python code above.

    ![Churn AutoML Task 3 Step 3 Scoring Notebook first screen](images/oml-churn-automl-notebook-sql-screen1.png " ")


    The second paragraph uses SQL to create a new table based on the `PREDICTION` and `PREDICTION_PROBABILITY` capabilities of Oracle SQL enabled by OML.  These are unique features in SQL for in-Database Dynamic Machine Learning Inference.   These functions can score any table that contains the columns necessary for computing the Probability.
    
    > **Note:** Oracle Machine Learning is resilient to missing data, and it can return a Probability computation even if there are missing data in some columns by replacing missing data using different techniques. 
    
    ![Churn AutoML Task 3 Step 3 Scoring Notebook second screen](images/oml-churn-automl-notebook-screen2.png " ")

    Please note that the following `SELECT` statement can be run by any Application connecting to this Autonomous Database instance through `JDBC`, and the scoring will be returned.

    Also remember that you need to change the name of the model being used from `CHURN_PRED` to something else if you decided to use a different name when you were doing the **Rename** of the model in **Step 1** of **Task 6**.

    ```
    <copy>
    SELECT * FROM
      (SELECT CUST_ID,
              PREDICTION(CHURN_PRED USING M.*) WILL_CHURN,
              ROUND(PREDICTION_PROBABILITY(CHURN_PRED, '1'  USING M.*),6) PROB_CHURN
              FROM MOVIESTREAM_CHURN M)
    ORDER BY PROB_CHURN DESC;
    ```

    The **SQL** code that follows the dynamic scoring is showing how to get the Prediction Details, this time via SQL, that gives us the `Reasons Why` each customer was predicted the way they were.
 
    For example, the first row indicates that CUST_ID = 1001689 was predicted to be a *Non-Churner* (`0`), since his probability to Churn was 3.5% (0.035), and the most important Features that were the reason for such prediction are:
    - Feature 1: `AVG_NTRANS_M3_5` = 11.67 with relative weight of 1.283
    - Feature 2: CREDIT_BALANCE = 0 with relative weight of 0.883
    - Feature 3: related to the customer GENDER
    And you can continue looking at the other Features by scrolling to the right.

    This means that the most important reasons why this person was identified as a *Non-Churner* by the model have to do with their age, their average number of transactions in the last quarter, the number of movies of the genre WAR, among others.
    ![Churn AutoML Task 3 Step 3 Scoring Notebook third screen](images/oml-churn-automl-notebook-screen3.png " ")

  You can scroll to the right and see more details, or select the other pages of customers as well.

**CONGRATULATIONS!!!**

You now have deployed a new table called `LATEST_POTENTIAL_CHURNERS` containing each customer's likelihood to churn and the decision (will the customer churn or not?) suggested by the Machine Learning model.

Now other professionals can take advantage of both the deployment you have just made in order to contact the customers at risk with an offer, as well as use your SQL Scoring code to put the model into production and run the scoring in batch every time there is a new refresh of the data, be it hourly, daily, weekly, or monthly.

## Task 9: Bonus content - auto-generated OML4Py notebook

<if type="ocw24sandbox">
## Task 7: Bonus content - auto-generated OML4Py notebook
</if>

   We can create an OML4Py auto-generated notebook with the model selected in the Leaderboard, that will contain all the steps necessary to recreate that model, including all hyperparameter settings.

1. While highlighting the row of the **`CHURN_PRED`** model, click **Create Notebook**

    ![Click Create Notebook](images/click-create-notebook.png " ")


2. Accept the default name, and then click **OK**.

    ![Accept default name](images/accept-default-name.png =60%x*)   

3. The notebook is created. A message box is displayed at the bottom of the screen. Click **Open Notebook**.
    
    ![Click Open Notebook](images/click-open-notebook.png " ")   

4. Let's run the entire Notebook so it will be easier to read. Click the **Run Paragraphs** icon at the top of the screen, next to the Notebook name. A **Run all paragraphs** dialog box is displayed. Click **Confirm**. 
    
    > **Note:** You might be asked to click **Allow Run** in the paragraphs that contain Markdown code. It is safe to do so in this case.
   
    ![Run Notebook](images/run-autogenerated-notebook.png " ")   

    The first section shows details of when the model was created, the username, input data, predict, algorithm and other details.

    ![First section](images/first-section.png " ")   

5. Scroll down in the notebook to see the next section. It is preparing a query that will include only the columns that were found to have significance to this particular model, and then it will create a proxy object to the data.
   
     ![Churn AutoML Task 9 Step 4 Data build](images/oml-churn-automl-autogenerated-proxy.png " ")   

6. The second section is building the input dataset and then creating the Random Forest model from scratch, showing the exact hyperparameters used to build the original model created via AutoML UI.  It also allows experts to make additional adjustments. The model is built using the _fit()_ function.
   
     ![Churn AutoML Task 9 Step 5 Model build](images/oml-churn-automl-autogenerated-model.png " ")   

7. The next section illustrates the output of the model just created, by showing the model details.  Scroll down for more model details.
   
     ![Churn AutoML Task 9 Step 6 Model details](images/oml-churn-automl-autogenerated-details.png " ")   

8. The last sections show how to score (generate inference) of customers, and verify the model quality as well using the open-source sklearn package from Python.

## Task 10: Bonus content - deploy the model to an OML Service REST endpoint

<if type="ocw24sandbox">
## Task 8: Bonus content - deploy the model to an OML Service REST endpoint
</if>

   We will deploy the selected model from the AutoML UI directly to a REST endpoint that is hosted by **Oracle Machine Learning Services**, and it is provided at no extra cost to all **Autonomous Database** customers.  Only the CPU consumed while actually scoring via REST would be charged, so there is no additional infrastructure needed for the model's REST API to be exposed.

1. Let's return to the OML AutoML Experiment results. Click the Navigation menu at the top of the Oracle Machine Learning page, and then click **AutoML Experiments** in the menu.

   ![Go back to AutoML](images/back-to-automl2.png " ")
   
2. The **AutoML Experiments** page displays the available experiments. Click the **`Detect potential churners`** experiment.

   ![Click experiment](images/click-experiment-2.png " ")

3. Scroll down to the **Leader Board** section, and click the **`CHURN_PRED`** row to highlight it in light blue. 

    ![Click first row and then click deploy](images/click-deploy.png =60%x*)

4. Click **Deploy**. The **Deploy Model - CHURN_PRED** dialog box is displayed with the details of the deployment. Specify the following information:
    - **Name:** Accept the default name, `CHURN_PRED`.
    - **URI:**  `churn_pred`
    - **Version:**  1.0
    - **Namespace:**  `OML_MODELS`
    - **(optional) Comment:** Profitability to Churn
    - **Shared checkbox:** Select it.
    
   ![Churn AutoML Task 10 Step 3 select experiment](images/deploy-model.png =60%x*)

5. Click **OK**. The **Detect potential churners** experiment is displayed.

6. Let's navigate to the OML Models interface. Click the Navigation menu at the top of the Oracle Machine Learning page, and then click **Models** in the menu.

   ![Click Models](images/click-models.png " ")

7. The **Models** page is displayed. All the models that we have built are available in the Database, and are listed here. We are interested in the Deployment that we just did. Click **Deployments**.

   ![Click Deployments](images/click-deployments.png " ")

8. The list of deployments is shown. In our case we have done only one. The URI column shows the deployment name that we assigned.

   ![The Deployments list is displayed](images/list-deployments.png " ")

9. Let's now check the deployed model's Metadata. Click **`CHURN_PRED`** in the **Name** column. The **Model metadata for CHURN_PRED** metadata is displayed. It contains the details about the model, the mining function it uses, the expected inputs that it requires, and the output labels that it produces. Close the list.

   ![Click churn_pred](images/click-churn-pred.png " ")

10. Let's now check the deployed model's **Open API Specification for CHURN_PRED**. Click the `churn_pred` in the URI column. The Open API specification contains the details about how to access the model via REST, gives the server details, and specifies the expected inputs and the output labels that it produces, as well as available options. Close the list when you're done.

   ![Click URI name](images/click-uri-name.png " ")

11. We are ready to deploy the Churn Model to an Application via REST. On the Database   Actions Launchpad, click the **Related Services** tab, and then click the **Oracle Machine Learning RESTful services** tab to find the specific address for your own model, since these are unique to each Autonomous Database instance.

    ![Click the Oracle Machine Learning RESTful services tab](images/click-tab.png " ")

   When developing Applications that can pass the information needed to get a score of the models, the OML Services REST API can return a sub-second score for a mini-batch of records, or you can request an asynchronous call for batch scoring as well.  
   
   ![Churn AutoML Task 10 Step 9 DB Actions Related Services](images/oml-churn-dbactions-related.png " ")

   For more details on how to use the deployed model and Oracle Machine Learning Services capabilities, make sure to look at that Lab in the [Oracle Machine Learning Fundamentals on Oracle Autonomous Database](https://livelabs.oracle.com/pls/apex/dbpm/r/livelabs/view-workshop?wid=922) workshop, which shows you how to use REST clients to access the model and more.
