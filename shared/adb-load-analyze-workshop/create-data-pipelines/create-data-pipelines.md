# Create Data Pipelines for Continuous Data Export and Import

## Introduction

Oracle Data Pipelines provide a continuous, incremental and fault-tolerant way to export and import data into ADB. With data pipelines, you can quickly and automatically load data into your database such as from your object store, as your ETL jobs and other data sources bring in new, clean data into your object store.

If you are loading data into or exporting out of ADB today, you are likely familiar with the `DBMS\_CLOUD` package that provides the ability to load data into your database from the object store with `DBMS\_CLOUD.COPY\_DATA` or export data to your object store using `DBMS\_CLOUD.EXPORT\_DATA`. You may find yourself performing these operations repeatedly (you may even have scheduled jobs) to work with new data that is flowing into your object store or tables. This new Data Pipeline feature introduces the package `DBMS\_CLOUD\_PIPELINE` to simplify and automate this process, providing a unified solution of scheduled jobs for periodic data load and export of new data files with intuitive configurable knobs, legible troubleshooting outputs and default parallelism for optimal scalability.

The two types of data pipelines available are:

1. **Load Data Pipelines**: Data pipelines used for periodically loading data into the database, from new data files lying in your object store of choice. Some use cases for load pipelines would be:
    - Continuous migration of new on-premise data sets into the database via the object store of choice, using a load pipeline
    - Loading new, incoming real-time analytic data or outputs of an ETL process into the database using a load pipeline, via data files store in the object store

2. **Export Data Pipelines**: Data pipelines used for periodically exporting new, incremental data as results from a table or query in the database, to the object store of choice. An example use case for export pipelines would be:
    - Exporting new time-series style data generated by your application from the database to the object store at periodic intervals

Now that we understand what a data pipeline is in ADB, let's walk through how to create and set up a pipeline, to understand how it works. The steps you will follow to create and use a data pipeline are:

  1. Create a new data pipeline to either load data into the database or export data from the database
  2. Configure your data pipeline by setting the right attributes as it relates to your data
  3. Test that the data pipeline loads or exports some sample data as expected
  4. Start a pipeline to continuously load or export your data

Estimated Time: 10 minutes

### Objectives

In this lab, you will:
* Create a data pipeline
* Configure the data pipeline attributes
* Test the data pipeline
* Start the data pipeline
* Upload data to your object storage bucket
* Check that the data pipeline loaded the data into the database
* Reset the pipeline's state and history

### Prerequisites

- This lab requires completion of the lab **Provision an Autonomous Database** found in the Contents menu on the left.

## Task 1: Create a data pipeline

Begin by creating a data pipeline to either load data or export data continuously.

1. Return to Database Actions and click **SQL** to open a **SQL Worksheet**. Click the **Copy** button to copy this code snippet into the worksheet and run this snippet for creating a data pipeline to load data. **Note the pipeline\_type parameter**:

    ```
    <copy>
    BEGIN
     DBMS_CLOUD_PIPELINE.CREATE_PIPELINE(
        pipeline_name => 'MY_FIRST_PIPELINE',
        pipeline_type => 'LOAD',
        description   => 'Load employee data from object store into a table'
    );
    END;
    /
    </copy>
    ```

## Task 2: Configure the data pipeline attributes

Next, you will set the right attributes for the data pipelines, such as the type of data files (for example JSON, CSV) and the location where the data files will lie (for example an object store bucket or file folder), as well as create the destination table in the database that your pipeline will load data into.

1. In this example, we are considering employee data so let's create the destination table **EMPLOYEE**:

    ```
    <copy>
    CREATE TABLE EMPLOYEE (name VARCHAR2(128), age NUMBER, salary NUMBER);
    </copy>
    ```

2. **DO I REFERENCE THE LABS IN LOAD AND ANALYZE TO CREATE BUCKET WITH DATA FILES IN IT AND A CREDENTIAL PARAMETER TO ACCESS IT FROM THIS WORKSHOP'S DATABASE? OR DO I COPY/PASTE THE TASKS FROM THAT WORKSHOP INTO HERE?**

    We have defined the attributes for the data pipeline below - Importing all data files of **JSON type** from an object storage bucket location at an interval of every 30 minutes (the default is 15 minutes) with a priority selected as High (that is, the HIGH database service name)

    In a previous lab, you created an object storage bucket and credentials to access that bucket from your autonomous database. Now you will set up continuous data loading using the object storage URL of your bucket.

    **Note**: For the credential, you may also setup [Resource Principles](https://docs.oracle.com/en/cloud/paas/autonomous-database/adbsa/resource-principal-use.html#GUID-EE5C24AD-34A5-4474-9B6A-9F606AABBA98) for the various different object store cloud providers to simplify access, if needed.

    Run the following code snippet in your SQL worksheet:

    ```
    <copy>
    BEGIN
     DBMS_CLOUD_PIPELINE.SET_ATTRIBUTE(
       pipeline_name => 'MY_FIRST_PIPELINE',
       attributes => JSON_OBJECT(
                    'credential_name' VALUE 'OBJECT_STORE_CRED',
                    'location' VALUE 'https://objectstorage.us-phoenix-1.oraclecloud.com/n/namespace-string/b/mybucket/o/',
                    'table_name' VALUE 'EMPLOYEE',
                    'format' VALUE '{"type": "json"}',
                    'priority' VALUE 'HIGH', 'interval' VALUE '30') );

    END;
    /
    </copy>
    ```

## Task 3: Test the data pipeline

Before we activate your configured pipeline, let's test that it works. Call the `DBMS\_CLOUD\_PIPELINE.RUN\_PIPELINE\_ONCE` procedure to run your pipeline once, on-demand. This will not create a repeating scheduled job.

1. Run the following code snippet in your SQL worksheet:

    ```
    <copy>
    BEGIN
    DBMS_CLOUD_PIPELINE.RUN_PIPELINE_ONCE(
            pipeline_name => 'MY_FIRST_PIPELINE'
    );
    END;
    /
    </copy>
    ```
2. You can monitor and troubleshoot your pipeline's running job by examining the `user\_cloud\_pipeline\_history` view or by querying the `status\_table` for each file in the pipeline via the `user\_cloud\_pipelines` view.

    Run the following code snippet in your SQL worksheet:

    ```
    <copy>
    SELECT pipeline_id, pipeline_name, status, error_message  
    FROM user_cloud_pipeline_history
    WHERE pipeline_name = 'MY_FIRST_PIPELINE';
    </copy>
    ```
    ![Monitor the running pipeline using queries](images/monitor-pipeline-running-job.png " ")

3. If something did go wrong causing your pipeline's file load to fail, you may query the database table `USER\_LOAD\_OPERATIONS` along with the operation IDs of your pipeline to get the related LOG and BAD files for the data load. This will provide insight into which lines in the data file cause a problem in the load.

    Run the following code snippets in your SQL worksheet:

    ```
    <copy>
    -- More details about the load operation in USER_LOAD_OPERATIONS.
    SELECT   owner_name, type, status, start_time, update_time, status_table, rows_loaded, logfile_table, badfile_table
        FROM user_load_operations
        WHERE id = (SELECT operation_id
                   FROM user_cloud_pipelines
                   WHERE pipeline_name = 'MY_PIPELINE1');
    </copy>
    ```

    ```
    <copy>
    --Query the relevant LOG and BAD files
    SELECT * FROM PIPELINE$4$21_LOG;
    SELECT * FROM PIPELINE$4$21_BAD;
    </copy>
    ```

Data Pipelines greatly simplify the repetitive nature of loading or exporting new data of similar structure, as it is being populated within a specified location or table. In addition to configuring your own data pipeline, we also provide [Oracle-maintained data pipelines mentioned here](https://docs.oracle.com/en/cloud/paas/autonomous-database/adbsa/pipelines-about.html#GUID-4CC0E833-DD11-4972-B959-508C4EC45A63) out of the box, that are preconfigured to export database logs to a selected object store location.
