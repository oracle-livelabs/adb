# Introduction

The labs in this workshop walk you through all the steps to get started using **Oracle Autonomous Database**. First, you will create an Oracle Autonomous Database instance. Then, you will practice several methods for loading data from a variety of locations and in different formats, using Autonomous Database tools and APIs. You will analyze the data with SQL and build analytics dashboards using Oracle Analytics Cloud.

Estimated Workshop Time: 1.5 hours

**Oracle MovieStream** is a fictitious movie streaming service - similar to those that you currently subscribe to. They face challenges that are typical to many organizations across industries. MovieStream must:
* Gain a better understanding of their customers to ensure that they love the service  
* Offer the right products to the right customers at the right price  
* Grow the business to become a dominant player in the streaming business
* and much, much more

Oracle Cloud provides an amazing platform to productively deliver secure, insightful, scalable and performant solutions. MovieStream designed their solution leveraging the world class Oracle Autonomous Database and Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) Data Lake services. Their data architecture is following the Oracle Reference Architecture [Enterprise Data Warehousing - an Integrated Data Lake](https://docs.oracle.com/en/solutions/oci-curated-analysis/index.html#GUID-7FF7A024-5EB0-414B-A1A5-4718929DC7F2) - which is used by Oracle customers around the world. It's worthwhile to review the architecture so you can understand the value of integrating the **data lake** and **data warehouse** - as it enables you to answer more complex questions using all your data.

In this workshop, we'll start with two key components of MovieStream's architecture. MovieStream is storing their data across Oracle Object Storage and Autonomous Database. Data is captured from various sources into a landing zone in object storage. This data is then processed (cleansed, transformed and optimized) and stored in a gold zone on object storage. Once the data is curated, it is loaded into an Autonomous Database where it is analyzed by many (and varied) members of the user community.

## **Workshop Objectives**
- Provision a new Oracle Autonomous Database instance
- Load data from files on your local computer
- Load data from object storage buckets
- Use Oracle Analytics Cloud to create compelling dashboards from your data set
- Load and analyze JSON collections
- Load the latest news from a public REST service and run a sentiment analysis of that news

### **Workshop Prerequisites**

This workshop requires an Oracle Cloud account. You may use your existing account or create one in the following lab.

> **Note**: Oracle Analytics Cloud (OAC) is not available with Oracle Cloud Free Tier (Always Free), nor is it supported in Oracle LiveLabs Sandbox hosted environments. If you run this workshop using an Always Free database or LiveLabs Sandbox environment, you can view Labs 1 and 5 on provisioning and using OAC, and later practice these steps on Oracle Autonomous Databases in your organization's tenancy.

**Let's begin! If you need to create an account, please click Get Started in the Contents menu on the left. Otherwise, if you have an existing account, click "Lab 1: Provision Autonomous Database".**
