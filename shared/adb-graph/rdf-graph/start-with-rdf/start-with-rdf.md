# Get Started with RDF Graphs
​
## Introduction
This lab walks you through the steps to get started by uploading the RDF data to a bucket that will be linked to the Autonomous Database. This requires copying the correct OCI username from the profile. To allow Graph Studio to access the RDF data in OCI Object storage (using the DBMS_CLOUD package), you must create an access token using your OCI account. This will be used in the secondary lab.
​

Estimated Time: 5 minutes
​
### Objectives
- Upload RDF Data into OCI Object Storage
- View your OCI User Name
- Generate Access token
​
### Prerequisites
  This lab assumes you have:
  - Oracle Cloud Account
  - Download the MOVIESTREAM file (moviestream\_rdf.nt) using this [link](https://c4u04.objectstorage.us-ashburn-1.oci.customer-oci.com/p/EcTjWk2IuZPZeNnD_fYMcgUhdNDIDA6rt9gaFj_WZMiL7VvxPBNMY60837hu5hga/n/c4u04/b/livelabsfiles/o/data-management-library-files/moviestream_rdf.nt)
​
​
## **Task 1:** Upload RDF Data into OCI Object Storage
