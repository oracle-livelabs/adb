# Lab 2: Create and Validate an RDF Graph User in Graph Studio

## Introduction
In this lab, we will create and validate an RDF Graph User in Graph Studio.

Estimated Time: 10 minutes

### Objectives
- Create a Graph User to Access RDF in Graph Studio
- Enable RDF for the Graph User
- Create RDF Graph in Graph Studio
- Validate the RDF Graph
- Execute SPARQL Queries on the Playground Page

### Prerequisites
This lab assumes you have:
  - An Oracle Free Tier or Paid Cloud Account
  - You have completed:
      - Lab 1: Provision an ADB Instance

## **Task 1:** Create a graph user to access RDF in Graph Studio

To work with RDF Graphs in Graph Studio, you must create graph users with granted roles. You can create Graph users with the correct set of roles and privileges using Oracle Database Actions.

Navigate to your Autonomous Database instance and create a graph user by following the steps below or as explained in [Create a Graph User](https://docs.oracle.com/en/cloud/paas/autonomous-database/csgru/create-graph-user.html)

1. Navigate to your Autonomous Database and click on your database display name to view its details.

2. Open up **Database Actions** from the toolbar.

  ![The Oracle Cloud Autonomous Database screen showing the Autonomous Database for Graph Studio.](./images/adb-details.png "")

3. From the Database Actions Launchpad, click **Database Users** from **Administration**.

4. Click **Create User** on the Database Users page in the **All Users** area.

  ![The database users page highlighting the 'create user' button](./images/database-users.png "")

5. Enter a user name and password.

Note: The password should meet the following requirements:

- The password must be between 12 and 30 characters long and must include at least one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, and one numeric character.

- The password cannot contain the username.

- The password cannot contain the double quote (â€œ) character.

- The password must be different from the last 4 passwords used for this user.

- The password must not be the same password that is set less than 24 hours ago.

**For example:** Password12345#

  *Write down or save your username and password as this will be needed in a later exercise.*

6. Enable **Graph**

7. Enable **Web Access** and expand Web Access Advanced Features, make sure authorization is required, your user name is the same as your REST Alias, and the URL Mapping Type is BASE_PATH.

8. Set the **Quota on Tablespace DATA** to Unlimited.

9. Click **Create User**.

    You should now be able to see your created user in the **All Users** section of the **Database Users** page or when you search for your user.

## **Task 2:** Create RDF graph in Graph Studio

Before we can create an RDF graph we must first import RDF data into Graph Studio.

1. Navigate to your Autonomous Database in the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Console and open Tools.

  ![Autonomous Database details showing the link to Graph Studio, accessible under 'Tools'](./images/database-tools.png "")

2. Open Graph Studio and log in with the user name and password you created in Lab 2, Task 9.

3. Click on Graphs on the navigation menu from the left to navigate the Graphs page.

  ![The 'get started' page for Graph Studio. On the left-hand navigation bar, the button for 'Graphs' is highlighted](./images/graph-studio-home.png "")

4. In the Graph Type dropdown menu select RDF and then click the Create button on the top-right corner of the interface.

  ![The Graph Studio page graph type dropdown menu displays PG and RDF graph options](./images/graph-studio-graphs.png "")

5. Create RDF Graph Wizard opens as shown:

  ![The 'create RDF graph' page.](./images/create-rdf-graph.png "")

6. Enter the OCI Object Storage URI path:

    ```

    ```

7. Click **No Credential**.

8. Click **Next**.
    The follow dialog should appear, enter "MOVIESTREAM" for Graph Name:

  ![The 'create RDF graph' second page](./images/create-rdf-graph-2.png "")

9. Click **Create**.

    The RDF graph creation job will be initiated. Since the RDF file contains 139461 records, the process may take 3 to 4 minutes. You can monitor the job on the **Jobs** page in Graph Studio.

  ![The 'jobs' page of Graph Studio displays a job 'Create a RDF Graph - MOVIESTREAM' still in progress](./images/graph-studio-jobs.png "")

    When succeeded, the status will change from pending to succeeded and Logs can be viewed by clicking on the three dots on the right side of the job row and selecting **See Log**. The log for the job displays details as shown below:

    ```

    ```

## **Task 3:** Validate the RDF graph

You can explore and validate the newly created RDF graph on the **Graphs** page in Graph Studio as shown:

1. Navigate to the **Graphs** page and set the **Graph Type** to RDF using the dropdown menu. Select the MOVIESTREAM graph row from the available RDF graphs, sample statements (triples or quads should appear), use the three horizontal dots to resize these statements, and bring them into view. Sample statements (triples or quads) from the RDF Graph are displayed on the bottom panel as shown:

  ![Sample statements from the RDF graph 'MOVIESTREAM' are displayed in triplets](./images/graph-sample-statements.png "")

2. After selecting the MOVIESTREAM Graph, scroll to the bottom of the page and verify that you see 500 rows of RDF triples have been retrieved.

  ![Sample statements from the MOVIESTREAM RDF graph](./images/sample-statements.png "")

## **Task 4** Execute SPARQL queries on the playground page

You can execute SPARQL Queries on the RDF Graph from the **Query Playground** page.

1. On the **Graphs** page select the **RDF** from the Graph Type dropdown menu and click the **Query** button to navigate to the Query Playground page.

  ![Graphs page with RDF graph type selected and the query button highlighted](./images/graph-type.png "")

2. If you have multiple graphs in graph studio, you will have to choose the graph to query. In the Graph Name menu, select the MOVIESTREAM from the dropdown menu.

  ![Query playground displays the graph name 'MOVIESTREAM' selected from the dropdown menu](./images/query-playground.png "")

3. Execute the following query for the RDF Graph.

    ```
    <copy>PREFIX rdf: &lthttp://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#&gt
    PREFIX rdfs: &lthttp://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#&gt
    PREFIX xsd: &lthttp://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#&gt
    PREFIX ms: &lthttp://www.example.com/moviestream/&gt

    SELECT DISTINCT ?gname
    WHERE {
      ?movie ms:actor/ms:name "Keanu Reeves" ;
      ms:genre/ms:genreName ?gname .
    }
    ORDER BY ASC(?gname)<copy>
    ```

      When the query is executed successfully the query output will be displayed as shown:

  ![Query playground displays the successful execution of a query on the MOVIESTREAM RDF graph and displays query results](./images/query-playground-script.png "")

This concludes this lab. *You may now proceed to the next lab.*
