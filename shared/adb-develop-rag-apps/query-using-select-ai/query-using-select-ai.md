# Use Natural Language Queries with ADB Select AI

## Introduction

Autonomous Database makes it simple to query your data using natural language. The person asking the question doesn't need to know where the data is stored, its structure or how to combine it with other data to get results. All these tasks are handled by a large language model and Autonomous Database.

As you can see from the previous labs, Select AI makes it easy to build apps that take advantage of natural language queries. In this lab, you'll experiment with a demo app that was built using Oracle APEX. When you ran the scripts to set up your environment, the APEX demo application was also installed. The app is probably the easiest way to get answers about your business and general internet content. Simply ask a question! You can then explore the result, get an understanding of the generated SQL (and even update it if you like), and manage conversations.

Estimated Time: 15 minutes.

### Objectives

In this lab, you will:

* Create a credential that is used to sign LLM API requests
* Create a profile that describes your LLM provider and the metadata (schemas, tables, views, etc.) that can be used for natural language queries.
* Ask natural language questions using an **Select AI** extension
* Modify the configuration to improve natural language results

### Prerequisites

- This lab requires completion of the first two labs in the **Contents** menu on the left.

## Task 1: Overview of Important Concepts

Before diving into the OML notebook in this lab, let's review some of the important concepts that you should know.

### **Use AI profiles to access your LLM**

An AI profile captures the properties of your LLM provider plus the tables and views you want to enable for natural language queries. You can create multiple profiles (e.g. for different providers), although only one is active for a given session or a particular invocation.

### **Create an AI Profile**

You can have multiple profiles where each one is pointing to different models or enabling different tables and views.

>**Note:** In this workshop, we are using OCI Generative AI and the resource principal.

To get started, you'll need to create a profile using the **`DBMS_CLOUD_AI.CREATE_PROFILE`** PL/SQL package that describes your _LLM provider_ and _the metadata such as schemas, tables, views, and so on that can be used for natural language queries_. You can have multiple profiles where each one is pointing to different models. For additional information, see the [CREATE_PROFILE procedure](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/autonomous-database-serverless/doc/dbms-cloud-ai-package.html#GUID-D51B04DE-233B-48A2-BBFA-3AAB18D8C35C) documentation.

_**Don't run the following code**_. This is for informational purpose in this task. In **Task 4** in this lab, you will import and run a Notebook that contains a paragraph that creates the following profile.

```
begin
    dbms_cloud_ai.drop_profile(
        profile_name => 'genai',
        force => true);
        dbms_cloud_ai.create_profile(
        profile_name => 'genai',
        attributes =>
        '{"provider": "oci",
        "credential_name": "OCI$RESOURCE_PRINCIPAL",
        "comments":"true",
        "object_list": [
        {"owner": "MOVIESTREAM", "name": "GENRE"},
        {"owner": "MOVIESTREAM", "name": "CUSTOMER"},
        {"owner": "MOVIESTREAM", "name": "PIZZA_SHOP"},
        {"owner": "MOVIESTREAM", "name": "STREAMS"},       
        {"owner": "MOVIESTREAM", "name": "MOVIES"},
        {"owner": "MOVIESTREAM", "name": "ACTORS"}
        ]
        }'
        );
end;
/
```

Since you can have multiple **Select AI** profiles, you need to pick the one to use for your session. Use the **`DBMS_CLOUD_AI.SET_PROFILE`** procedure to specify which profile to use as follows:

```
<copy>
BEGIN
    DBMS_CLOUD_AI.SET_PROFILE(profile_name => 'genai');
END;
/
</copy>
```

### **Ask Natural Language Questions**

You can now ask questions using **`SELECT AI`**. **`AI`** is a special keyword in the `SELECT` statement that tells Autonomous Database that the subsequent text will be either an action or the natural language question.

Here are the actions:

1. **`chat`**: Use for general AI chat.
2. **`runsql`** [default]: Use to ask a question and get a structured result.
3. **`narrate`**: Use to ask a question and get a conversational result.
4. **`showsql`**: Use to show the SQL code that was used to produce the result.

Let's look at a couple of examples:

1. **`Chat`** simply makes a request to the LLM provider using your prompt.

    ```
    SELECT AI chat
    What is Tom Hanks best known for
    ```

    **Result:**

    `Tom Hanks is best known for his acting career, particularly for his roles in popular films such as "Forrest Gump," "Saving Private Ryan," "Cast Away," "Apollo 13," and "Toy Story" (as the voice of Woody). He is widely regarded as one of the greatest actors of his generation and has won numerous awards, including two Academy Awards for Best Actor.`

2. The default for `SELECT AI` is `runsql`. This will run queries against your private data:

    ```
    SELECT AI
    What are total sales of tom hanks movies
    ```
    **Result:**

    `70,318.23`

 3. View the SQL code that is generated by the following question:

    ```
    SELECT AI showsql
    What are total sales of tom hanks movies
    ```
    **Result:**

    `SELECT SUM(sales_sample.list_price) AS total_sales
    FROM moviestream.sales_sample
    JOIN moviestream.movie ON sales_sample.movie_id = movie.movie_id
    WHERE movie.cast LIKE '%Tom Hanks%' `

    Notice that to answer the previous question, the sales data was joined to the movie table and a filter was applied to the CAST column.

    >**Note:** _LLMs are remarkable at inferring intent - and getting better all the time. But, they are not perfect! It is very important to verify the results._

    For example, let's say you ask the question "What are our total streams for Tom Hanks movies this month?". The LLM will interpret the question and produce SQL that will provide an answer.

    ```
    SELECT m.title AS movie_title, COUNT(s.views) AS total_streams
    FROM movie m
    JOIN sales_sample s ON m.movie_id = s.movie_id
    JOIN actors a ON m.movie_id = a.movie_id
    WHERE a.actor = 'Tom Hanks' AND EXTRACT(MONTH FROM s.day_id) = EXTRACT(MONTH FROM SYSDATE)
    GROUP BY m.title;
    ```

    ![Query output](./images/output.png =50%x*)

  We can see the total number of views for each movie where Tom Hanks was an actor; however, what if you expected movies that he also produced and directed? This may not be what you expected.

_**In summary, using LLMs infer a lot from human language. It's always good to verify your results.**_

You may now proceed to the next lab.
