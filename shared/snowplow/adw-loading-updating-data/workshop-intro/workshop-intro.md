# Introduction

## About this Workshop

The purpose of this workshop is to introduce you to Oracle Cloud and the unique capabilities of Oracle's Autonomous Data Warehouse.

**NOTE:** The timings shown in the notes and screenshots for this workshop assume an ADW instance configured with 1TB of storage and 16 ECPUs. You can configure your own ADW instance with fewer ECPUs and still use the scripts below. However, while all the scripts will complete successfully, the timings for some of the steps will be longer.

Estimated Workshop Time: 1 hour

### Who Should Use This Workshop?

Everyone can benefit from doing the exercises listed in this guide: technical experts (data warehouse architects to database administrators), business users who want to focus on extracting meaning and insight from their own data, along with data scientists who want to build machine learning models within the context of a data warehouse project.

### Welcome to Oracle MovieStream

Oracle MovieStream is a fictitious on-line movie streaming company. Customers log into Oracle MovieStream using their computers, tablets and phones where they are presented with a targeted list of movies based on their past viewing habits. The company is now looking for better, smarter ways to track performance, identifying customers to target with campaigns that promote new services, new movies and new viewing platforms. Many of the scenarios in this workshop will very likely match the challenges you are seeing in your business and we hope the following labs and accompanying workshops will give you some insight into how Oracle can help you solve these common everyday business and technical challenges.
