# Wrap up of the Data Studio overview workshop


## Introduction

This lab will summarize the workshop. 

## Task 1: Wrap up

We started this workshop with a Monday morning team meeting. John, VP of marketing, wanted to send discount offers to high-value customers. He also had questions about individual preferences of movie genre based on age groups, marital status, customer value etc.

Let's go through the action items again. 

1. Transform and prepare data

    For analysis, we added various customer attributes to this movie sales data. The Transforms tool made this task easy with a drag-and-drop user interface. 

2. Analyze data

    Finally, we analyzed the data across various customer attributes. We also found interesting results unearthed by the Insights process. 

Various tools of Data Studio worked seamlessly with each other, helping us complete all the action items successfully.

Now we are ready for our next Monday meeting.
