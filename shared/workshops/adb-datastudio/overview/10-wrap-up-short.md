# Wrap up of the Data Studio overview workshop


## Introduction

This lab will summarize the workshop and guide you through the steps to clean demo data. 

## Task 1: Wrap up

We started this workshop with a Monday morning team meeting. John, VP of marketing, wanted to send discount offers to high-value customers. He also had questions about individual preferences of movie genre based on age groups, marital status, customer value etc.

Let's go through the action items again. 

1. Transform and prepare data

    We created customer quintiles based on total sales by the customer and loaded them into a new table. For analysis, we added various customer attributes to this table as well. The Transforms tool made this task easy with a drag-and-drop user interface. 

2. Analyze data

    Finally, we analyzed the data. We created an analytic view (AV), which is a dimensional model, and learned how to analyze 
    the data across various dimension hierarchies. We also found interesting results unearthed by the Insights process. 

Various tools of Data Studio worked seamlessly with each other, helping us complete all the action items successfully.

Now we are ready for our next Monday meeting.
