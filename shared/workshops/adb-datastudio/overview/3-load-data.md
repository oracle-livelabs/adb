# Using Load Data to load additional data set


## Introduction

This lab introduces the Load Data application built into the Oracle Autonomous Database and shows how to load new data set.

### Prerequisites

To complete this lab, you need to have completed the previous labs, so that you have:

- Created an Autonomous Data Warehouse instance
- Created a new QTEAM user with appropriate roles
- demo data loaded

## Task 1: Create local data file for AGE_GROUP

We need to analyze the movie sales data by age group as well. While browsing catalog,
we noticed that there is no age group information, and we need to load a
new table for age group.

For this we will go back to our database actions page by clicking on the
top left button and use Load Data tool.

1.  We need to create a local data file for AGE_GROUP. Launch Excel on
    your desktop to create this dataset. Note that you can also use a
    text editor to create this data set since it is small.

    Save this as AGE_GROUP Excel workbook.

    If you don't have Excel then create a csv file with the data as below
    and save it as AGE_GROUP.csv.

    *For copy/pasting, be sure to click the convenient __Copy__ button in the upper right corner of the following data text*:Â 
    
```
\"MIN_AGE\",\"MAX_AGE\",\"AGE_GROUP\",

0,20,\"00-20\",

21,30,\"21-30\",

31,40,\"31-40\",

41,50,\"41-50\",

51,60,\"51-60\",

61,70,\"61-70\",

71,80,\"71-80\",

81,200,\"Older than 81\",
```

## Task 2: Load data file for AGE_GROUP

1.  Launch Data Load from Database Actions page by clicking on **DATA
    LOAD** card.

    Note that you have various modes for loading data. You can either
    directly load data or leave it in place simply linking it. You can
    also create ongoing feed to load data to Autonomous Database.
    
    You can also load data from either your local file, database or from a
    cloud storage.
    
    In this lab we are loading data from the local file created in earlier
    task. Selected **LOCAL FILE** and press **Next**.

3.  Press on the green triangle button to start the load.

    After the load is complete, click on the Database Actions link on top
    of the page to go back to the main menu.
    
    Now we all the data sets that we need to complete our assignment.
