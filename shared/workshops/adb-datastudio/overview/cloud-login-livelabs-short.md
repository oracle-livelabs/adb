# Get started - LiveLabs login

## Introduction

To get started, you need to have an active Oracle Cloud account and a LiveLabs reservation. An Oracle Cloud account is free and needed to gain access to your LiveLabs reservation, Oracle Support, and other Oracle publicly-accessible content.

If you already have an Oracle Cloud account, you can skip to Task 2.

If you already have a reservation, skip to the next lab to start your workshop!

Estimated Time: 5 minutes

### Objectives

- Create an Oracle cloud account
- Request workshop reservation on LiveLabs
- Launch workshop

3. After creating a reservation for a LiveLab Workshop, you will receive an e-mail indicating that your reservation is being processed, followed by an e-mail indicating that your environment has been created.

4. Log into LiveLabs. Click your username, and click **My Reservations**. Then click the **Launch Workshop** link for the Workshop environment you'd like to use. Note that you may have several Workshops listed.
