# Introduction
Data Studio has a collection of tools for various needs. We will start with Data Catalog to look for the data we need.

## Task 1 â€“ Launch Database Action
Login to the Autonomous Database created earlier with your user and password. You can see various tools under Data Studio.

Note: Bookmark the Database Actions page so that it is easier to come back to this later in the workshop.
Click on DATA STUDIO OVERVIEW card.
 
It shows the list of recent objects in the middle. On the left, it has links to individual tools and on the right, link to documentation.

Since it is a workshop, there are limited objects in the list. There will be many objects and only the recent objects are shown here. We will use the Catalog tool to browse the objects and find what we need.
