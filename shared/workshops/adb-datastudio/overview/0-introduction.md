# Introduction

## About this Workshop

This is an introductory workshop for the Data Studio. It goes through a day in the life of a Data Analyst and shows how to use it to browse, load, transform and analyze the data in the Autonomous AI Database.

Estimated Workshop Duration: 1 hour, 30 minutes

### Who should use this Workshop?

This workshop is useful for anyone who needs to have a working knowledge of loading, transforming and doing data analysis in the Autonomous AI Database. 

### Objectives

In this workshop, you will learn:
-	How to browse the catalog to find the data you need
-	How to load data from your local file
-	How to transform and prepare your data for analysis
-	How to create a dimensional model and analyze the data
-	How to find hidden insights

### Prerequisites

Before you launch into this workshop, you will need the following:

- Basic knowledge of Oracle Cloud
- Basic level of understanding of SQL query language

### How to use the Workshop

Once you have completed labs 1, 2, and 3 - that is, you have provisioned an Autonomous AI Database (or have one ready to use), created a user and loaded demo data, you have an option to sequentially complete all the labs or jump to any other lab. These labs are designed to be independent of one another. For example, if you want to learn about analyzing data in the Autonomous AI Database, you can skip directly to lab 8.

However, we recommend that you complete all the labs in sequence to understand how the various tools in Data Studio work together.

If you have any questions about the topics covered in this lab and the entire workshop, please contact us by posting on our public forum on  **[cloudcustomerconnect.oracle.com](https://cloudcustomerconnect.oracle.com/resources/32a53f8587/)**  and we will respond as soon as possible.
