Now you are ready to go through the rest of the labs in this workshop.

## Task 1: Create a dimensional model for data analysis

We have movie sales, movie genre and age group data. We also have customer value 
information. We will analyze this data set. 

We will go through a few examples such as movie genre 
preference based on age groups and marital status and whether these
preferences are different across high-value and low-value customers.

1.  Navigate to the Database Actions page and launch the **DATA ANALYSIS** tool.

    ![screenshot of data analysis card](images/image58_analysis_card.png)

2.  The first time when you access the data analysis tool, you will see a
    guiding wizard that will describe various parts of the UI. Since you
    are doing this lab anyways, click on X to cancel it and start using
    the tool right away.

    ![screenshot of data analysis home page](images/image59_analysis_home.png)

3.  To Analyze your data, create an Analytic View (AV) first. Analytic
    Views organize data using a dimensional model, allowing you to
    easily add aggregations and calculations to data sets and present
    data in views that can be queried with relatively simple SQL.

    We don't have any AV yet, therefore we are going to create one.
    
    Select your schema QTEAM and click on **Create** button.

    ![screenshot of creating the analytic view](images/image60_av_create.png)

4.  The default AV name is derived from the fact table. Enter various fields
    as follows:

    Name: **CUSTOMER_SALES_ANALYSIS_AV**
    
    Caption: **Customer sales analysis av**
    
    Description: **Customer sales analysis av**
    
    Schema: **QTEAM**
    
    Fact Table: Pick **CUSTOMER_SALES_ANALYSIS** from the list
    
    You can find related tables and hierarchies by clicking on **Generate
    Hierarchy and Measures** button. This will scan your schema and find
    all the tables related to **CUSTOMER_SALES_ANALYSIS** and give you a
    starting point.
    
    However, in our case, we have prepared the data in such a way that all
    analysis attributes are in one table. We don't need to run this
    automated process.

    ![screenshot of selecting the fact table](images/image61_av_table.png)

5.  Now click on Data Sources on the left side to verify that
    CUSTOMER_SALES_ANALYSIS is the data source.

    ![screenshot of data sources](images/image62_av_datasource.png)

6.  Now click on the Hierarchies on the left side and add the attributes
    we want in our analysis. We want to add **AGE_GROUP, CUST_VALUE,
    DEVICE, MARITAL_STATUS, GENRE,** and **PET**. It will be interesting
    to do a movie preference analysis with pets.
    
    >**NOTE:** These are all single-level hierarchies. Adding multiple-level
    hierarchies is an advanced topic and will not be covered. However, we will
    see that even with single-level hierarchies, we can do many interesting
    analyses.

    ![screenshot of adding hierarchies](images/image63_av_hier.png)

7.  If you don't see your column, then click on **More columns** at the end of the list
    and search for your columns. Then add it by clicking on it.

    ![screenshot of adding hierarchies by searching](images/image64_av_hier_pick.png)

8.  After you add all, it should look like the below screenshot.

    ![screenshot of hierarchy preview](images/image65_av_hier_list.png)

9.  Now click on Measures and add a measure using the **TOTAL_SALES** column

    ![screenshot of adding a measure](images/image66_av_measure.png)

10. We have completed our AV. Click on **Create** it and confirm **OK**.

    ![screenshot of creating an analytic view](images/image67_av_create.png)

11. Our AV is ready now and we can start analyzing data. You can see
    that there are no errors. By clicking on the **Data Quality** tab.

    You can also go back and edit the AV by clicking on three vertical
    dots.

    ![screenshot of analytic view review](images/image68_av_quality.png)

## Task 2: Analyze data

Now the fun part starts. All this time we were preparing the data and
creating a dimensional model in AV. We will start creating reports, and charts
and start finding hidden patterns in the data.

Next, let's learn how to navigate the analysis tool.

1.  Select your AV and click on **Analyze**.

    These zones are:
    
    1: Hierarchies and measures
    
    2: Columns, Rows, Values and Filters where you can drag components
    from zone 1 to slice and dice the data.
    
    3: Area for displaying reports and charts.
    
    4: Table/Pivot/Chart view. For the remainder of the lab, we will use chart
    view. It is much easier to visualize the information through charts.
    
    5: Insights. Automated algorithm to search for hidden patterns. This
    is the topic of our last lab. For now, we will click on the right-side
    divider bar to collapse it.

    ![screenshot of the analysis home page](images/image69_av_analyze_home.png)

2.  Now we can start doing our first analysis.

    Analysis: show me SALES_AMOUNT by AGE_GROUP
    
    Select chart mode. Clear all hierarchies from X-Axis and drag **Age
    group** to X-Axis and **Total Sales** to Y-Axis.

    >**Note:** You need to expand the hierarchy tree to reveal the level. 
    Only the level can be dragged to the analysis area. In our workshop, there 
    is only one level to all hierarchies and hence, they are named 
    the same. In a more complex model, you may have multiple levels inside a 
    hierarchy.
    
    This chart is showing total sales across age groups. We can
    conclude that seniors (71-80) are not watching many movies whereas age
    groups 21-30 and 31-40 are watching most.

    ![screenshot of sales analysis by age group](images/image70_sales_agegroup.png)

3.  Next, let us analyze sales by marital status.

    Clear X-Axis and drag **Marital status**.
    
    You will have to expand the left side tree node to drag the level.
    A Level is under the hierarchy node (with the same name for convenience).
    
    We can see that singles are watching more movies than married people.

    ![screenshot of sales analysis by marital status](images/image71_sales_maritalstatus.png)

4.  Now we can mix two hierarchies. Drag **Age group** above **Marital
    status** in X-Axis. 

    Make sure the **Age group** is on top of **Marital status**.

    We notice that although singles watch overall more movies, married
    people watch more than singles in the young age group (21-30, 31-40).
    
    This was not obvious before.

    ![screenshot of sales analysis by marital status and age group](images/image72_sales_maritalstatus_age.png)

5.  Now we are curious to know which genre sells most.

    Clear X-Axis and drag **Genre**.
    
    Drama Sells! Followed by Action.

    ![screenshot of sales analysis by movie genre](images/image73_sales_genre.png)

6.  We had earlier ranked our customers in high and low-value buckets.
    It will be interesting to find out whether there is a movie genre
    preference for high-value customers.

    Clear X-Axis and drag **Genre** and **Cust value**. Make sure the **Cust value** is 
    on the top.
    
    The chart is very wide, and you can't see to the right. To
    fit the entire width you can drag the right edge of the lower window
    towards the right till all customer values are visible on one page. If 
    you don't see the lower window then zoom out on the browser with CTRL -.

    ![screenshot of sales analysis by movie genre and customer value](images/image74_sales_genre_custvalue.png)

7.  Let's look at this chart. We can see that Drama is very popular with
    high-value (**Cust value**=5) customers, whereas Action is more popular
    with low-value customers (**Cust value**=1).

    Of course, most of the bars are taller for high-value customers
    because overall they spend more. We are talking about relative genre 
    preference within the same customer value group.

    ![screenshot of sales analysis by movie genre and customer value](images/image75_sales_genre_custvalue_detail.png)

Go ahead and see if you can find any other interesting patterns. 

What movie genres are popular in different age groups?

We can spend lots of time in the analysis tool visualizing the data with
different combinations of attributes.

>**Note:** So far, we are looking at only the charts, but this data can be
displayed in tabular format and a pivot table as well. Switch the
display mode to see how it works. Advanced users can access the data in
this AV from Excel or Google Sheets. 

## RECAP

In this lab, we used the Data Analysis tool to first create a dimensional model (Analytic View) on
the sales analysis table and then analyze movie sales across various dimensions such as age groups, 
marital status, movie genre etc. 

We found many interesting patterns in customer purchasing behavior. 

Note that there are many more features in the analysis tool, which are not covered here. 
These details will be covered in another in-depth workshop.

You may now **proceed to the next lab**.
