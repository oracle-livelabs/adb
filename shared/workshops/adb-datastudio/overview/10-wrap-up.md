# Wrap up of the Data Studio overview workshop


## Introduction

This lab will summarize the workshop and guide you through the steps to clean demo data. 

## Task 1: Wrap up

We started this workshop with a Monday morning team meeting. John, VP of marketing, wanted to send discount offers to high-value customers. He also had questions about individual preferences of movie genre based on age groups, marital status, customer value etc.

Let's go through the action items again. 

1. Find relevant data

    We learned how to use the catalog tool to look for desired tables. There are different ways to search, preview the data and do a quick profile check.

2. Load data

    Age group data was missing from the database. There are many ways to 
    import data from various sources into an Autonomous database. We imported it from our local file.

3. Transform and prepare data

    Now we had all the tables we needed. We created customer quintiles based on total sales by the customer and 
    loaded them into a new table. For analysis, we added various customer attributes to this table as well. The Transforms 
    tool made this task easy with a drag-and-drop user interface. 

4. Analyze data

    Finally, we analyzed the data. We created an analytic view (AV), which is a dimensional model and learned how to analyze 
    the data across various dimension hierarchies. We also found interesting results unearthed by the Insights process. 

Various tools of Data Studio worked seamlessly with each other, helping us complete all the action items successfully.

Now we are ready for our next Monday meeting.



## Task 2: Clean demo data

>**Note:** Cleaning demo data is optional. If you want to keep the demo data then skip it.

1. To remove the tables and views created during this workshop from your database simply copy and paste this code into your SQL Worksheet.

    *For copy/pasting, be sure to click the convenient __Copy__ button in the upper right corner of the following code snippet.*:Â 

    ```
    <copy>
DROP TABLE CUSTOMER_CA;
DROP TABLE MOVIESALES_CA;
DROP TABLE GENRE;
DROP TABLE MOVIE;
DROP TABLE TIME;
DROP TABLE AGE_GROUP;
DROP TABLE CUSTOMER_SALES_ANALYSIS;
DROP ANALYTIC VIEW CUSTOMER_SALES_ANALYSIS_AV;
    </copy>
    ```
2. Paste the SQL statements in the worksheet. Click on the **Run Script** icon.

    >**Note:** Expect to receive "ORA-00942 table or view does not exist" or "ORA-18307: analytic view CUSTOMER\_SALES\_ANALYSIS\_AV does not exist" errors during the DROP command if objects are already dropped, but you should not see any other errors.

    Now you have cleaned the tables and analytic view created in this workshop.
