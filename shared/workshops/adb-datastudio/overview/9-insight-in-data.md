# Explore hidden patterns in your data


## Introduction

This lab introduces Data Studio’s Data Insights tool built into the Oracle Autonomous Database and shows how to search for and interpret data insights.

Estimated Time: 15 minutes

Watch the video below for a quick walk-through of the lab.

### Objectives

In this workshop, you will learn:
-	How to find hidden insights in your data

### Prerequisites

To complete this lab, you need to have completed the previous labs, so that you have:

- Created an Autonomous Data Warehouse instance
- Created a new QTEAM user with appropriate roles
- Created Analytic view CUSTOMER\_SALES\_ANALYSIS\_AV

## Task 1: Use Data Insights

Data Studio's insights process runs in the background, finding interesting patterns 
in the data. This is a hands-off approach to
finding insights that are lurking out of sight in the data.

In this lab, we will investigate a few sample insights produced by the tool.
We will learn how to interpret it and will cross-check it with manual
analysis.

>**Note:** The insight process can run for some time depending on the
complexity of the data set and available compute resources. Our data set
is small enough that it will complete in a reasonable time. But you might
see the insight list being refreshed while it is executing.


1.  Launch Data Insights by clicking on the Database Actions link on the
    top and then click on the **Data Insights** card.

2.  On the **Data Insights** page click on the top right icon to get a tour of the
    tool.

3.  Click Next to go through each area and learn about it.

4.  You can pick AV or any table to run insights on. 
    If you are using an AV, you can pick any measure to run insights against,
    whereas if you want to run insights against a single table then you can pick any column
    which you think is a measure.

    Pick **CUSTOMER\_SALES\_ANALYSIS\_AV** for the analytic view, and **TOTAL\_SALES**
    for the column. 
    
    Click **Search**
    
    >**NOTE:** These insights are stored in the database and can be accessed at any
    time for review. You can also regenerate the analysis if the data in
    the underlying AV/table has changed. The order of
    insights may vary if the data is different or the insight is still
    running, therefore refer to the labels on each tile to identify it.

    A list of various insights will appear on the page. The Data Insights tool has gone through the data and discovered
    many interesting behavioral patterns based on the movie sales data.
    
    
    For our workshop we will focus on three insights labeled in the screenshot:

      1: Purchasing pattern of singles across Genre

      2: Interest in adventure genre across age group 

      3: Purchasing behavior of dog owners across age groups
        
    ![screenshot of the list of insights](images/image79_inst_list.png)

5.  Click on the tile marked **S** on the top and **Genre** at the
    bottom. It shows

    1: TOTAL_SALES (our measure driving the insight) in **blue** bars for
    **Marital Status=S** across **Genre**. This is the actual value.
    
    2: Each bar has a **green** horizontal line depicting the average,
    without the **Marital Status=S** filter. It is called the **expected** value.
    It can differ from the blue level if the data is skewed for the filter
    on the top (**Marital Status=S**).
    
    3: A few bars are surrounded by a black border (pointed by arrows). These
    are highlighted exceptions.
    
    Another way to read this is:
    
    **Singles** are purchasing **Adventure** and **Comedy** more than
    average and are not very interested in **Drama**.
    
    That is an interesting insight.  
    
    ![screenshot of insights on singles and genre](images/image80_inst_maritalstatus_genre.png)

    Click on the **Back** button to go back to the list.

6.  Click on the tile marked **Adventure** on the top and the **Age group** at
    the bottom.

    It shows that gen-Z is above average interested in adventure genre. This might be an obvious insight but the data is confirming it.

    ![screenshot of insights on adventure and age group](images/image81_inst_adventure_age.png)

    Click on the **Back** button to go back to the list.

7.  Now, just for fun let's look at the pet ownership and movie purchase
    relationship.

    Click on the tile marked **Dog** on the top and **Cust Value**.
    
    It shows that the highest value (5) dog owners are purchasing far more movies than average compared to non-dog owners. It may be just a correlation but perhaps you could use this data to offer dog grooming products to high-value customers!
    
    Interesting. Isn't it? The Data Insights tool has discovered all these hidden
    patterns just by crawling through the data.

    ![screenshot of insights on pet ownership and customer value](images/image82_inst_pet_custvalue.png)

    Wow! That's quite an insight!! 

    Click on the **Back** button to go back to the list.

There are many other insights in the list. Go back to the list and look at a few others. See if you find any other interesting insight. The Data Insight tool has discovered all these hidden patterns just by crawling through the data.

## Task 2: Peeling the layers of Data Insights

This section is an attempt to explain the insights by manually running
queries and correlating them with what we can see in insights.

1.  Let's go back and look at the first insight again.

    Click on the tile marked **S** on the top and **Genre** at the bottom. This 
    was the movie genre preference of singles. It showed singles are purchasing 
    adventure and comedy more than the average and purchasing less drama genre than 
    the average.

    ![screenshot of singles by genre insight](images/image83_inst_single_genre.png)

2.  We can go back to the **Data Analysis** tool to confirm this
    insight. Go back to the data analysis tool and click on the previously created AV to create a new analysis.

    ![screenshot of applying the filter for marital status](images/image84_analyze_peeling_layer_home.png)

3.  In this new report we will analyze **sales** by **Genre** for married and singles alternately.

    Drag **Genre** on X-Axis (you will have to expand the tree on the left). 
    Pick **M** in the filter box on the right for marital status.

    ![screenshot of applying the filter for marital status](images/image84_analyze_filter.png)

4.  Married people are watching **Drama** a lot and not much
    **Adventure** and **Comedy**.

    ![screenshot of sales analysis to married people by genre](images/image85_analyze_married_genre.png)

5.  Now let's compare it for singles. Deselect **M** and select **S** in the right hand side filter for marital status.

    This is what you get. Notice high purchases in the **Adventure** and
    **Comedy** genre by singles and not much **Drama** (compared to
    married people).

**Isn’t that what Data Insights told us?! It discovered that without any input from us!**

While doing manual analysis in the **Data Analysis** tool, 
we must actively look at and compare the data for
certain hierarchies. There are many combinations, but people use their
experience to guide their analysis steps. In comparison, **Data
Insights** is a hands-off approach and it finds patterns without
understanding what hierarchies mean.

We think that both are complementary to each other and provide valuable
tools to use in "a day in the life of a data analyst".

## RECAP

In this lab, we examined various insights discovered by the Data Insights tool. 
They were interesting insights and not very obvious without digging into the data.

We also compared the results with the Data Analysis tool by doing manual analysis, illustrating 
the value of automated insights.

Now all the assigned tasks have been completed successfully.

You may now **proceed to the next lab**.
