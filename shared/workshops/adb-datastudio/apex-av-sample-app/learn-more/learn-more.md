# Learn More

Most of what you need to know centers on designing and querying analytic views. Start with simple models and gradually build toward more advanced use cases.

As an APEX developer, it's helpful to understand:

- The semantic model  
- Analytic View DDL syntax  
- SQL query patterns for analytic views
