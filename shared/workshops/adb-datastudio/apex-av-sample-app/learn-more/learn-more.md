# Learn More

Most of what you need to learn has to do with designing and querying analytic views. Start simple and work towards more complex use cases.  APEX developers will find it important to understand the semantic model, analytic view DDL statements, and more details about querying analytic views using SQL.

### Learn More at Live SQL

Analytic View Quick Start tutorials on Oracle Live SQL are a great place to start.

- [Analytic View Quick Start Part 1 - Create AVs using Simple DDL](https://livesql.oracle.com/apex/livesql/file/tutorial_OXFYP3OODMIZICXPSZ71O58UG.html)
- [Analytic View Quick Start Part 2 - Simple Query Templates for Developers](https://livesql.oracle.com/apex/livesql/file/tutorial_OXRHLW558R6D9PTUNCNPB96OZ.html)

The deep dives provide more detail and include the descriptive metadata used by applications such as Oracle Analytic Cloud.

### Oracle Autonomous AI Database Data Studio

The Oracle Autonomous AI Database Data Studio includes tools for designing and querying analytic views. Learn more at this Oracle Live Lab:  [Get Started With Analytic Views using Data Studio](https://livelabs.oracle.com/pls/apex/dbpm/r/livelabs/view-workshop?wid=3594)

### Analytic Views and Oracle Analytic Cloud

Oracle Analytic Cloud has native support for Analytic Views. Oracle Analytic Cloud can import Analytic Views into Subject Areas and query them using advanced Analytic View features.  You can learn more by watching this short video:  [Oracle Analytics Native Connection to Analytic Views in Database](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmhVGvEB98k&t=53s)
