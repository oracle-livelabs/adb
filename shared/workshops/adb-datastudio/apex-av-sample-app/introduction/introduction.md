# Introduction

## About This Workshop

This workshop uses Oracle APEX and Oracle Analytic Views to build an app for analyzing sales data. It focuses on how Analytic Views simplify SQL, support interactivity, and make it easy to add calculations to reports and charts.

### About Analytic Views

An Analytic View is a type of view in Oracle Database that lets you run complex queries and calculations across one or more tables. It provides a higher-level, easier-to-use layer for analyzing data.

Analytic Views are ideal for business intelligence and data warehousing. They can be built on single or multiple joined tables.

### Why Use Analytic Views with APEX?

APEX developers write the SQL behind reports, charts, and visualizations. As apps become more interactive and calculation-heavy, this SQL becomes harder to write and maintain. Often, developers turn to dynamic PL/SQL to generate the needed queries.

Analytic Views solve this by:

- Hiding source tables, joins, and logic inside the view
- Providing a simplified, flat structure
- Supporting fast, easy-to-read SQL for queries

This makes SQL easier to write, debug, and maintain.

Analytic Views also generate optimized SQL for execution, improving performance without manual tuning.

**Bottom line:** APEX developers can build richer apps, reduce complexity, and improve performance using Analytic Views.

### Objectives

In this workshop, you will:

- Learn core Analytic View concepts  
- Understand the types of Analytic Views  
- Query Analytic Views using sample SQL  
- Build an APEX app using a predefined Analytic View
