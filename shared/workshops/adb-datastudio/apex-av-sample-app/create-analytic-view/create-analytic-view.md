# Create an Analytic View

## Introduction

This lab uses three hierarchy views and an analytic view that reference the tables created in the previous lab.  You will create these objects using a script.

This analytic view could be created using the Database Actions Data Studio Analysis tool.  To learn how, see the [Get Started With Analytic Views using Data Studio](https://apexapps.oracle.com/pls/apex/r/dbpm/livelabs/view-workshop?wid=3594) Live Lab.

Estimated Time:  5 minutes.

### Objectives

In this lab, you will:

- Create attribute dimensions, hierarchies, and an analytic view.

### Prerequisites:

- Complete the previous lab.

## Task 1 - Create the Analytic View objects.

To create the analytic view objects used in this lab.

1.  Using SQL Worksheet, connect to the database using the  **MOVIESTREAM** (or other) user created in Lab 3.
2.  Run the following commands in SQL Worksheet.  They can be run all at once as a script or individually, as you prefer.

## Task 2 - View the Analytic View in Database Actions Analysis

You can view the analytic view in the Database Actions Analysis application.

1.  Return to the Database Actions Launchpad
1. Choose **DATA ANALYSIS** application in the **Data Studio** section.
1.  Using the vertical ellipsis (...)  choose Analyze.

![Start Analysis](images/start-analyze.png)

The basic structure of the analytic view is displayed in the tree on the left side.  You will see three hierarchies, columns in the hierarchies, and four measures.  A report is displayed on the right side.

![Start Analysis](images/analysis-report.png)

Feel free to experiment with the Analysis application for a few minutes.

You can also view the analytic view in the editor.

1.  Return to the Analysis application home screen.
1.  Using the virtual ellipsis (...)  choose Edit.

![Start Analytic View editor](images/start-analysis-edit.png)

Feel free to explore the editor.

 When you are done exploring the editor:

1. Press the **Cancel** button to exit out. **Do not make changes to the analytic view or press the Update button.**

You may now **proceed to the next lab**
