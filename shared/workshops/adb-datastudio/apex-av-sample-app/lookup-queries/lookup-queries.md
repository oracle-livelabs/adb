# Examine Lookup Queries

## Introduction

There are many times when the APEX developer also needs to write queries to provide a list of values for a select list, a pop-up list of values, a radio list, or a tree.

Estimated Time:  5 minutes.

### Objectives

In this lab, you will:

- Examine and run queries used to provide lists of values for APEX items.

### Prerequisites:

- Complete the previous lab.

## Task 1 - List of Geographies

You may need a list of all geographies from the CUSTOMER_DIM table for a pop-up LOV (list of values) item on a page in your APEX application.  If the list of values is for a single level, for example, countries, you can provide a SQL Query like this.

~~~SQL
<copy>
SELECT
  DISTINCT continent AS d,
  continent AS r
FROM
  customer_dim
ORDER BY
  continent;
  </copy>
~~~

You need another query if you need a list for a different level.  For example:

~~~SQL
<copy>
SELECT
  DISTINCT country AS d,
  country r
FROM
  customer_dim
ORDER BY
  country;
  </copy>
~~~

## Task 2 - A List of Geographies with Multiple Levels

If you need a list with more than one level, you might use a query such as this:

~~~SQL
<copy>
SELECT DISTINCT
    continent AS d
  , continent AS r
FROM
    customer_dim
UNION
SELECT DISTINCT
    country AS d
  , country AS r
FROM
    customer_dim
UNION
SELECT DISTINCT
    state_province AS d
  , state_province AS r
FROM
    customer_dim;
</copy>
~~~

## Task 3 - A List of Geographies with Multiple Levels and Hierarchical Metadata

Including hierarchical metadata enriches the list of geographies, allowing for filters using levels or hierarchy depth.  You might use a query such as this.

~~~SQL
<copy>
SELECT DISTINCT
    continent   AS d
  , continent   AS r
  , 'Continent' AS "LEVEL"
  , 1           AS depth
  , continent   AS continent
  , NULL        AS country
FROM
    customer_dim
UNION
SELECT DISTINCT
    country   AS d
  , country   AS r
  , 'Country' AS "LEVEL"
  , 2         AS depth
  , continent AS continent
  , country   AS country
FROM
    customer_dim
UNION
SELECT DISTINCT
    state_province   AS d
  , state_province   AS r
  , 'State/Province' AS "LEVEL"
  , 3                AS depth
  , continent        AS continent
  , country          AS country
FROM
    customer_dim
ORDER BY
    depth
  , continent
  , country
  , d;
  </copy>
  ~~~

You could create a similar query for time periods.

~~~SQL
<copy>
SELECT DISTINCT
    year   AS d
  , year   AS r
  , 'Year' AS "LEVEL"
  , 1      AS depth
  , year   AS year
  , NULL   AS quarter
  , NULL   AS month
FROM
    time_dim
UNION
SELECT DISTINCT
    quarter   AS d
  , quarter   AS r
  , 'Quarter' AS "LEVEL"
  , 2         AS depth
  , year      AS year
  , quarter   AS quarter
  , NULL      AS month
FROM
    time_dim
UNION
SELECT DISTINCT
    month   AS d
  , month   AS r
  , 'Month' AS "LEVEL"
  , 3       AS depth
  , year    AS year
  , quarter AS quarter
  , NULL    AS month
FROM
    time_dim
UNION
SELECT DISTINCT
    to_char(day_id, 'DD-MON-YYYY') AS d
  , to_char(day_id, 'DD-MON-YYYY') AS r
  , 'Day'                          AS "LEVEL"
  , 5                              AS depth
  , year                           AS year
  , quarter                        AS quarter
  , month                          AS month
FROM
    time_dim
ORDER BY
    depth
  , year
  , quarter
  , month
  , d;
</copy>
~~~

There must be a better way!

You may now **proceed to the next lab**
