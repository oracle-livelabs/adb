## Introduction

Must of what you need to learn has to do with designing and querying analytic views. Start simple and work towards more complex use cases.

### Oracle Autonomous Database Data Studio

The Oracle Autonomous Database Data Studio includes tools for designing and querying analytic views. Learn more at this Oracle Live Lab:  [Get Started With Analytic Views using Data Studio](https://apexapps.oracle.com/pls/apex/r/dbpm/livelabs/view-workshop?wid=3594)

### Learn More at Live SQL

You can learn a lot about Analytic Views by reviewing the DDL used to create them.  [Oracle Live SQL](https://livesql.oracle.com/apex/f?p=590:49:::NO:RP,49:P49_SEARCH:analytic%20views) has many Analytic View tutorials and is a great place to learn more.

### Analytic Views and Oracle Analytic Cloud
