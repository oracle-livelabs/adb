# Using Python API to create and execute Data Transforms objects


## Introduction

This lab introduces you to Python API for Data transforms. You can create Data Transforms object using Python scripts. 

Estimated Time: 10 minutes

### Objectives

In this workshop, you will learn how to:
-   Install Python package 
-	Write Python script to create Data transforms objects

### Prerequisites

To complete this lab, you need to have completed the previous labs, so that you have:

- Created an Autonomous AI Lakehouse instance
- Created the users DT\_DEMO\_SOURCE and DT\_DEMO\_DW with appropriate roles
- Installed Python in your local desktop
- Installed Visual Studio Code. This is a development environment for writing Python script. Users can use any other environment to write script but this lab uses Visual Studio Code to explain the steps.

## Task 1: Install Python package for Data Transforms

## Task 2: Test connection to your Data Transforms environment


## Task 3: Write your Python script


## RECAP

In this lab, we learned how to write a Python script to create Data Transforms objects.

You may now **proceed to the next lab**.
