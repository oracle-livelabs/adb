# Cleaning demo data for the Data Studio overview workshop


## Introduction

This lab will guide you through the steps to clean demo data. 

>**Note:** This lab is optional. If you want to keep the demo data then skip it.

## Task 1: Execute the script

1. To remove the tables and views create during this workshop from your database simply copy and paste this code into your SQL Worksheet.

*For copy/pasting, be sure to click the convenient __Copy__ button in the upper right corner of the following code snippet.*:Â 

```
<copy>
DROP TABLE CUSTOMER_CA;

DROP TABLE MOVIESALES_CA;

DROP TABLE GENRE;

DROP TABLE MOVIE;

DROP TABLE TIME;

DROP TABLE AGE_GROUP;

DROP TABLE CUSTOMER_SALES_ANALYSIS;

DROP ANALYTIC VIEW CUSTOMER_SALES_ANALYSIS_AV;

</copy>
```
2. Paste the SQL statements in the worksheet. Click on the **Run Script** icon.

>**Note:** Expect to receive "ORA-00942 table or view does not exist" or "ORA-18307: analytic view CUSTOMER\_SALES\_ANALYSIS\_AV does not exist" errors during the DROP command if objects are already dropped, but you should not see any other errors.
