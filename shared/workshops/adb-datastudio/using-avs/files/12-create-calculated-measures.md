# Create a Calculated Measure

## Introduction

In the Analytic View, there are two types of measures:

-   **Fact measures** are from the fact table. Fact measures are mapped to the fact table and include aggregation operators.

-   **Calculated measures** are created using expression. Calculated measures reference fact measures or other calculated measures, and do not include aggregation operators.

The analytic view includes an expression language used for calculated
measures. You can also use any SQL single-row function in the definition
of a calculated measure.

Estimated Time:  5 minutes.
