# Create a Hierarchy

## Introduction

Every Analytic View must reference at least one hierarchy.  A hierarchy can have one or more levels, where a level is a collection of hierarchy members at the same level of aggregation. For example, Months, Years, Cities, and Countries might be levels or Time and Geography hierarchies

A hierarchy organizes levels into aggregation paths. For example, Days aggregate to Months, Months aggregate to Quarters, and Quarters aggregation to Years.

In the terminology of the Hierarchy view, the Day level is the child of the Month level, the Month level is the child of the Quarter level, and so on.

Hierarchies can use data from lookup tables or directly from the fact table.  In this lab, all hierarchies will be created from lookup tables.

To create a hierarchy, you will:

- Add a new table to the Analytic View.
- Create levels.
- Specify the joins between the hierarchy table and the fact table.

### Objectives

In this lab you will:

- Create a hierarchy.

### Prerequisites:

- Complete the previous lab.

Estimated Time:  10 minutes.

## Task 1 - Add a New Table

Right-click on Data Sources and Choose Add Hierarchy Sources.

![Add Hierarchy Sources](../images/7-add-hierarchy-sources-1.png)

2. **Turn off Generate and Add Hierarchy from Source** (you will do that yourself) and choose the TIME_DIM table.

![Add Hierarchy Sources](../images/7-add-time-dim-hier-source.png)

The table will be added to the sources.  You will specify the join between this table and the fact table after you create levels in the hierarchy.

## Task 2 - Create a Time Hierarchy

A hierarchy is created by choosing a column of a hierarchy table. A level in the hierarchy is automatically created. Additional levels can be added later.

1. Right-click Hierarchies.

2. Choose TIME_DIM.

3. Choose YEAR.

**Pro-tip:** Add levels from the highest level to the lowest level and you will not need to sort the levels later.

![Add Hierarchy Sources](../images/7-add-time-hierarchy.png)

A hierarchy named YEAR with a single level, YEAR, will be created.

![New Time Hierarchy](../images/7-new-time-hierarchy.png)

Whether you like the name YEAR for this hierarchy is a matter of personal opinion (or more importantly, the end user's opinions).  Because this hierarchy will have additional levels, rename the hierarchy to Time.

4. Select the **YEAR** hierarchy (as shown above).

4. Enter **TIME** in the Hierarchy Name field.

5. Enter **Time** in the Caption field.  You can also enter **Time** in the Description.

![Rename Hierarchy to Time](../images/7-rename-hier-to-time.png)

You can choose to set the hierarchy to Time. Some applications might benefit from knowing that the hierarchy is Time, but that is not required for time series calculations such as LEAD and LAG.  xLeads and lags are calculated using the order of members within the hierarchy as set by the Sort By property in the Analysis design tool (which sets the ORDER BY property of a level in the attribute dimension SQL DDL).

## Task 3 - Add Quarter, Month, and Day Levels

Next, you will add the Quarter, Month and Day levels to the Time hierarchy.

Viewing data in the TIME_DIM table may help you understand what additional levels can be added to the hierarchy.

1. Press the **Preview Data** button.

![Preview Time Table](../images/7-preview-time-table.png)

Hierarchies include one or more levels where each member of a child (lower) level has a single parent value in the parent (upper) level. For example, each day belongs to a single month, each month belongs to a single quarter, and each quarter belongs to a single year. Some people call this a *natural hierarchy*.

A hierarchy of DAY_ID > MONTH > QUARTER > YEAR fits the description of a natural hierarchy.

A hierarchy such as DAY\_ID \> MONTH\_OF\_YEAR > QUARTER > YEAR does not fit the description of a natural hierarchy because there is more than one QUARTER value for each MONTH\_OF\_YEAR.

2. Press the **Close** button to close the preview.

3. Click on **Add Level** and choose the **QUARTER** column.

![Preview Time Table](../images/7-add-quarter-level.png)

4  Repeat for the **MONTH** and **DAY** levels using the **MONTH** and **DAY_ID** columns.

![All Time Levels](../images/7-all-time-levels-sorted.png)

## Task 4 - Examine Level Properties

1. Select the YEAR level.

![Year Level Properties](../images/7-year-level-properties.png)

Notes about level properties:

- By default, the level and all properties use the column selected when creating the level.  Because YEAR is a good name for the level, the level name does not need to be changed.
- Values in the top section (Level Name, Caption and Description) are identifiers. These are names and descriptors in the model.
- Values in the bottom section (Level Key, Member Name, etc.) map the column to data elements of the hierarchy.
  - **Level Key** is the unique identifier of the hierarchy members.
  - **Member Name**, **Member Caption**, and **Member Description** are all ‘slots’ in the hierarchy where properties of the hierarchy member can be included. Member Caption is almost always used as a friendly name for the Level Key. This is important when the Level Key value is not a user-readable value.
  - If any of the columns used as Member Name, Member Caption, and Member description have a 1:1 relationship with the Level Key, that column can be used as an **Alternate Key**.  Alternate Level Keys are useful in some cases, but that is a more advanced topic.
  - Hierarchies have a default sort order. This is determined by the values in the column mapped to **Sort By**.  The default order is important because it is used in some LEAD and LAG calculations.  Applications can also use that column to order hierarchy values in a query.

In this data, a single column can be used for all properties of a level. As a result, you do not need to make any changes.

It is common for different columns in a table to be used for different properties of a level. For example, if the unique key of a level is an integer value or some other code (for example, a product code) you would probably use a different column for the Caption and Sort By properties   This is most common for the lowest level of a hierarchy when the lookup table is joined to the fact table.

**Pro tip**:  Easy analytic view design starts with good column names in tables.  The Analysis design tool will use column names as the default for hierarchy, level and measure names (replacing underscores with spaces in Captions).

Feel free to examine the properties of each level.

You may now **proceed to the next lab**
