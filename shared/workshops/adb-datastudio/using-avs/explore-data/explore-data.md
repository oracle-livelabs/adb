# Explore Data

## Introduction

Your Analytic View now includes multiple hierarchies and a time-based calculation.  
Itâ€™s ready for deeper analysis.

**Estimated Time: 5 minutes**

### Objectives

You will:

- Explore data using the Analysis Viewer tool.

### Prerequisites

- Complete the previous lab.

## Task 1 - Create a New Report

After updating the Analytic View, the tool returns to the **Analysis Viewer**.

3. Expand the **Time** hierarchy. Drag **MONTH** to the **Columns** section. 
4. Expand the **Geography** hierarchy.  Drag **Continent** to **Rows** under **Genre Name**. 
4. Expand **Measures**. Drag **SALES\_PCT\_CHG\_PRIOR\_PERIOD** to **Values**.  

The first month has no prior period data, so values are null.  
Scroll right to view later months.
