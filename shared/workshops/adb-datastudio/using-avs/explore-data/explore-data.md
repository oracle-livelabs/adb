# Explore Data

## Introduction

The Analytic View now has several hierarchies and a time series
calculation. It will be more interesting to analyze with this additional content.

Estimated Time:  5 Minutes.

### Objectives

In this lab you will:

- Use the Analysis Viewer tool to explore data in the Analytic View.

### Prerequisites:

- Complete the previous lab.

## Task 1 - Create a New Report

The application will return to the Data Quality tab after the analytic
view has been updated. As before, there are no errors.

1. Choose the **Analyze** tab.
2. Choose the **Report** icon (be sure to choose the middle icon).

3. Expand the Time hierarchy and move **MONTH** to the **Columns**
    position.
4. Expand Measures and add **SALES\_PCT\_CHG\_PRIOR\_PERIOD** to the
    **Values** position.
5. When prompted, choose Format Type **Percentage** and **Save**.

The first month has Sales data, but because it is the first month the
prior period values are null.

7. Scroll the report to the right to see prior period values.

the Row position.

## Task 2 - Explore On Your Own

Feel free to add new calculations and explore the data on your own.
After all, that's what this is all about.

You may now **proceed to the next lab**
