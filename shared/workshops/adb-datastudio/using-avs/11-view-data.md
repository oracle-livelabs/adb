# Introduction

The Analysis Application includes a Analytic View data viewer.  You can use this viewer to review the Analytic View and check the data.

## Task 1 - Review Data in the Analytic View

To view the data in the Analytic View, choose the Analyze tab and define a query in a report or graph.

1. Choose the **Analyze** tab.

The application chooses a level (Year in this case) and a measure (sales), and displays a report.

2. Switch to a chart by pressing the **bar chart** button in the upper, right corner of the application.

A bar chart with Years is displayed. Add **Months** to the Chart.

3.	Expand the **Time** hierarchy, select **Month**, and drag it under **Year** in the **X-Axis** position.

The chart now displays Month within Year.
