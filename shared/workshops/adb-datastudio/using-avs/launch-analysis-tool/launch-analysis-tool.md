# Launch the Data Studio Analysis Tool

## Introduction

Estimated Time:  10 minutes with 2 ecpus.

This lab uses the Database Actions Data Studio Analysis tool to design the Analytic View.

Estimated Time:  Less than 5 minutes.

### Objectives

In this lab you will:

- Launch the Data Studio Analysis tool.

### Prerequisites:

- Complete the previous lab.

##  Task 1 - Access Database Actions

The Database Actions tools can be accessed directly using a URL or through the Autonomous AI Database console.

If you are running this lab in your tenancy and do not have access to the Autonomous AI Database console,  ask the administrator of the database to provide you with the URL.

1. If you have access to the Autonomous AI Database console, choose Database Actions.

2. If you have launched Database Actions from the Autonomous AI Database console, you are probably logged in as the ADMIN user. Sign out of Database Actions from the top right banner if you are logged in as ADMIN.

The first time you open the Analysis Application, introductory cards will be displayed to give you a tour of the UI.  You can choose to review the cards to gain an understanding of the UI, or you can simply close them.
