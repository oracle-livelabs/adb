# Introduction

You will need to connect to Autonomous Database and run SQL commands to create a user, add workshop utilities, and load sample data.  This lab provides instructions for connecting to SQL Worksheet using your browser. If you use a different tool such as SQL Developer desktop, you can use that tool.
