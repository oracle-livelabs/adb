# Introduction

Your Analytic View definition now includes one hierarchy, joined to the fact table, and a measure. The Analytic View can be created in the database.

## Creating the Analytic View

This step is very simple.

1. Smash (press) the Create button!

Congratulations, you now have an Analytic View deployed in the database! There is also an Attribute Dimension and Hierarchy.

The Analysis tool will automatically switch out of Analytic View design to the Data Quality tab.  This tab will let you know if there are certain types of errors found in the tables.  Since this is a Live Lab, there are no errors!
