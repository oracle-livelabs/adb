# Introduction

## Workshop Overview

This workshop shows you how to create **Analytic Views** in **Oracle Autonomous Database** using the **Data Studio Analysis** tool. It's designed to be short, simple, and beginner-friendly.

You’ll build a basic Analytic View that introduces the business model and key features. You'll also use the Analysis tool to view and verify your design.

Data Studio generates all the DDL required to create an Analytic View. You can review the DDL in the tool. For a deeper dive, explore the [**Oracle Live SQL: Creating Analytic Views – Getting Started**](https://livesql.oracle.com/apex/livesql/file/tutorial_EDVE861IID1QUD1NIUPU5ALEW.html) tutorial.

## What Is an Analytic View?

An **Analytic View** is a database object that simplifies complex queries and calculations across one or more tables. It provides a semantic layer for easier analysis and is ideal for business intelligence and data warehousing. Developers benefit from simpler SQL and built-in support for calculations.

## Workshop Objectives

In this lab, you will:

- Quickly create a simple Analytic View using Data Studio
- Learn the core features of Analytic Views
- Define dimensions, hierarchies, and fact measures
- Add calculated measures
- View and verify your Analytic View design in Data Studio

## Sample Data

The lab uses a simplified version of the **MovieStream** dataset—a fictional video streaming service. The dataset focuses on core concepts and supports sales analysis by time, geography, and genre.

## Prerequisites

To complete this workshop, you should have:

1. Basic knowledge of Oracle Cloud  
2. Basic understanding of SQL

If you have questions, please post them on our [**Oracle Cloud Customer Connect forum**](https://cloudcustomerconnect.oracle.com/resources/32a53f8587/) and we’ll respond promptly.
