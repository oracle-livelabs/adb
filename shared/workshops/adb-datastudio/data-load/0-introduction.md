# Introduction

## About this Workshop

The purpose of this workshop is to provide details about the many ways in which you can load data into the Oracle Autonomous AI Lakehouse using its built-in Data Studio application. 

The workshop is designed to be used alongside your own cloud account (paid or Bring-Your-Own-License) or you can register and claim free trial credits which provides up to 3,300 hours of cloud time, and 2 TB of storage, which is more than enough time and storage space to run this workshop. 

Estimated Workshop Duration: 1 hour, 20 minutes

### Who should use this Workshop?

This workshop is useful for anyone who needs to load data into the Autonomous AI Lakehouse.

### How to use the Workshop

Once you have completed labs 1 and 2 - that is, you have provisioned an Autonomous AI Database (or have one ready to use) and created a user, you can choose to complete any of the other labs, as they are designed to be independent from one another.
