# Introduction

## About this Workshop

The labs in this workshop show you a variety of ways to manage and monitor your **Oracle Autonomous Database Serverless**. You will provision a new ADB instance, practice connecting to the database securely with and without a connection wallet, examine a variety of ways to monitor database performance and other metrics, apply scaling and auto scaling, enable disaster recovery using Autonomous Data Guard, create refreshable database clones, set event and alarm notifications, and secure your data using Oracle Data Safe.
