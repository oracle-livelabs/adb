# Introduction

## About this Workshop

Application migration is the complex process of moving an application from one environment to another. This process involves a series of steps, including migrating SQL statements as the statements transition from a non-Oracle database to an Oracle database. Each step of the migration must be performed carefully to ensure that the application functions seamlessly in the new environment.
The purpose of this workshop is to introduce you to the `DBMS_CLOUD_MIGRATION` package. The `DBMS_CLOUD_MIGRATION` package facilitates you to easily migrate applications to Autonomous Database, when the applications were developed for non-Oracle databases that use a different SQL flavor.

**<i>Note: At present, the `DBMS_CLOUD_MIGRATION` package only supports the migration of SQL statements written in <b>PostgreSQL</b>.</i>**


## Objectives

- Provision an Oracle Autonomous Database
- Translate individual SQL statements from a non-Oracle database to Oracle SQL
- Run PostgreSQL Statements in Autonomous Database
- Translate files containing SQL code from a non-Oracle database to Oracle SQL
