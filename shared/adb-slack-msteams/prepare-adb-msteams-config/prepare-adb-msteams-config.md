# Configure the Microsoft Teams Application

**Important:** This lab uses features which are not available on the Oracle LiveLabs Sandbox hosted environments (the Green button), and requires Microsoft Teams admin permissions.

## Introduction

Microsoft Teams serves as a comprehensive collaboration platform within the Microsoft 365 ecosystem, facilitating instant messaging, audio and video calls, and online meetings. With its seamless integration with other applications, Teams enhances productivity by streamlining communication and project management. Microsoft Teams supports a wide range of integrations with external apps and services.

This lab walks you through the steps to create your Microsoft Teams application and channel to receive messages, alerts and output of a query from Autonomous Database.

Estimated Time: 15 minutes

### Objectives

In this lab, you will:

+ Create your Microsoft Teams application
+ Create and configure a bot for your Microsoft Teams application

## Task 2: Create and configure a bot for your Microsoft Teams application

For this task, you will create and configure a bot for your Microsoft Team application.  A bot is the application designed to interact through conversation and it is also referred to as a chatbot or conversational bot. It's an app that runs simple and repetitive tasks by users such as customer service or support staff. Everyday use of bots include, bots that provide information about the weather, make dinner reservations, or provide travel information. Interactions with bots can be quick questions and answers or complex conversations. For more information, see [Build bots for Teams](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/bots/what-are-bots).

1. Click the **Navigation menu** that is located on the left side panel.

    ![Open ADB](./images/click-lines.png "")

2. Click **Tools** in the Navigation menu, and then click **Bot management** in the **Tools** section.

    ![Open ADB](./images/bot_management.png "")

3. Click the plus sign next to **New Bot** to create your bot.

    ![Open ADB](./images/select_newbot.png "")

4. Enter your bot name in the **Bot name** field, and then click **Add**.

    ![Open ADB](./images/click_bot_name.png "")

7. Select the **Client secrets**, and then click **Add a secret** to create a client secret for your bot.

    ![Open ADB](./images/add_secret.png "")

8. After you create the client secret, click the **Copy** icon next to the code to copy the secret which you will need in later steps. This is the only time the generated secret will be displayed. Next, click **OK** close it.

    ![Open ADB](./images/create_secret_key.png "")

9. Select **Apps** from the Navigation menu, and then click your application **Name**.

    ![Open ADB](./images/select-appname.png "")

10. Scroll down to the **Configure** section, and then click **App features**.

    ![Open ADB](./images/select_app_features.png "")

11. In the **App features** section, click **Bot** to set up required scope and permission for your application.

   ![Open ADB](./images/select_appfeatures_bot.png "")

    > **Note:** Bots are conversational apps that carry out a predetermined set of tasks. Bots interact with people, answering their inquiries and informing them in advance of changes and other happenings. For more information, see [Build bots for Teams](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/bots/what-are-bots?referrer=developerportal).

12. Specify the following parameters that are shown in the screen capture to set up your bot's scope, and then click **Save**.

    - Identify your bot: Click **Select an existing bot**
    - What can your bot do: Click **Only send notifications**
    - Select the scopes where people can use your bot: Click **Team**

   ![Open ADB](./images/add_scope_permission.png "")

    > **Note:** Selecting the "team" scope provides the bot functionalities such as accessing to team channels, ability to interact with multiple users in a team, and  retrieving team-specific data. Fore more information, see [App scope](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/concepts/design/understand-use-cases?referrer=developerportal#app-scope).

## Task 3: Publish your Microsoft Teams application

After creating your application successfully, the next crucial step is toÂ publish it to your organization. This process ensures that your application becomes accessible to all users within your organization.

1. Go to your [Apps](https://dev.teams.microsoft.com/apps), click your application **Name**.

    ![Open ADB](./images/select-appname.png "")
