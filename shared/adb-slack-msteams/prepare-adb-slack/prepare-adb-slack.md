# Send Slack Notifications from Autonomous Database

**Important:** This lab uses features which are not available on the Oracle LiveLabs Sandbox hosted environments (the Green button), and requires Slack admin permissions. If you run this lab using a LiveLabs Sandbox environment, you can only review the steps and later practice the steps using your organizationâ€™s Slack workspace.

## Introduction

Slack, a leading collaboration tool, enables teams with the ability to have seamless communication and efficient data management. Slack has cool integrations with external apps and sources.

This lab walks you through the steps to configure your Slack application to receive messages, alerts, and the output of a query from Autonomous Database. You will learn the required procedures to send Slack notifications.

Estimated Time: 25 minutes

### Objectives

In this lab, you will:

+ Create your Slack application
+ Configure your Slack application
+ Create your Slack channel
+ Create a credential object to access the Slack application from Autonomous Database
+ Configure access control to allow user access to external network services
+ Send messages to a Slack channel
+ Send query results to a Slack Channel

### Prerequisites

+ Completion of the lab **Get Started** and **Lab 1** from the **Contents** menu on the left.

## Task 2: Configure your Slack application

After creating your application, you must request scopes which will grant your application permissions to perform actions such as viewing basic information, posting messages, and uploading files in your selected workspace.

These following scopes are  required:

+ **channels:read**

    This permission scope will enable you to view basic information about public channels in your workspace. For more information, see [channels:read](https://api.slack.com/scopes/channels:read).
+ **chat:write**

    This permission scope will enable you to post messages in approved channels and conversations. For more information, see [chat:write](https://api.slack.com/scopes/chat:write).
+ **files:write**

    This permission scope will enable you to upload, edit, and delete files from your Slack app. For more information, see [files:write](https://api.slack.com/scopes/files:write).

1. Go to [Your Apps](https://api.slack.com/apps), and then click your **App Name**.

    ![Open ADB](./images/click-app-name.png "")

    ![Open ADB](./images/add-an-app.png "")

9. Enter your Slack app **name**, and select your preferred workspace.

    ![Open ADB](./images/select-add.png "")

10. If successful, you will receive a message as shown in the screen capture below.

    ![Open ADB](./images/app-added-channel.png "")

## Task 4: Create a credential object to access the Slack application from Autonomous Database

For this task, you will use **`DBMS_CLOUD.CREATE_CREDENTIAL`** procedure which enables you to access the cloud service for data loading, and querying external data in the cloud. For more information, see [`CREATE_CREDENTIAL procedure`](https://docs.oracle.com/en/cloud/paas/autonomous-database/serverless/adbsb/dbms-cloud-subprograms.html#GUID-742FC365-AA09-48A8-922C-1987795CF36A).

1. In the Oracle Cloud console, open the **Navigation menu**, navigate to **Oracle Database**, and then select **Autonomous Data Warehouse**.

    ![Open ADB](./images/click-adb.png "")

2. Select your **Autonomous Database instance**.

    ![Open ADB](./images/click-adb-name.png "")

3. Click **Database actions**, and then select **SQL** .

    ![Open ADB](./images/select-database-actions.png "")

4. To create credential object to access the Slack app from Autonomous Database, you need to obtain your **Bot User OAuth Token**.

    > **Note:** Bot tokens are authentication tokens, enabling your bot to interact with the workspace's API to send and receive messages. For more information, see [Bot tokens](https://api.slack.com/concepts/token-types#bot).

5. Access the [Your Apps](https://api.slack.com/apps) page, and then click your app.

6. Scroll down to the **Features** section, click **OAuth & Permissions**, and then copy your **Bot User OAuth Token**

    ![Open ADB](./images/copy-bot-token.png "")

    > **Note:** Once your application is approved by your Slack admin, **OAuth Tokens** will be generated. If the approval is not granted, you will not see the **OAuth Tokens for Your Workspace** section as described in the step 6.

7. To create credential object to access the Slack app from Autonomous Database,set the following parameters, copy and paste the following code into your SQL Worksheet, and then click the **Run Script (F5)** icon in the Worksheet toolbar.

    - credential_name: Enter **`SLACK_CRED`**
    - username: Enter **`SLACK_TOKEN`**
    - password: Enter your **Bot User OAuth Token**

    ```
    <copy>
    BEGIN
     DBMS_CLOUD.CREATE_CREDENTIAL(
      credential_name => 'SLACK_CRED',
      username    => 'SLACK_TOKEN',
      password    => 'xoxb-34....96-34....52-zW....cy');
     END;
    </copy>
    ```

    ![Open ADB](./images/create-credential.png "")

    > **Note:** If you can not run the `CREATE_CREDENTIAL` procedure successfully, you can consult the ADMIN user to grant execute access on `DBMS_CLOUD` packages.

    You can leave the SQL window open and continue with the next Task.

## Task 5: Configure access control to allow user access to external network services

In this task, you will use **`DBMS_NETWORK_ACL_ADMIN.APPEND_HOST_ACE`** procedure to grant the access control privileges to a user. For more information, see [Configuring Access Control for External Network Services](https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/oracle-database/19/dbseg/managing-fine-grained-access-in-pl-sql-packages-and-types.html#DBSEG-GUID-3D5B66BC-0277-4887-9CD1-97DB44EB5213).

1. In the source database SQL window, enter the following script, set the following parameters, and then click **Run Statement**.

    - principal_name: Enter  your database user name or role such as **ADMIN**.
    - principal_type: Enter **`xs_acl.ptype_db`** for a database user or role.

    ```
    <copy>
    BEGIN
       DBMS_NETWORK_ACL_ADMIN.APPEND_HOST_ACE (
          host         => 'slack.com',
          lower_port   => 443,
          upper_port   => 443,
          ace          => xs$ace_type(
          privilege_list => xs$name_list('http'),
          principal_name => enter_db_user_name_or_role,
          principal_type => xs_acl.ptype_db));
    END;
    </copy>
    ```

    ![Open ADB](./images/run-acl.png "")

    You can leave the SQL window open and continue with the next Task.

## Task 6: Send messages to a Slack channel

After creating required credential and configuration, you can use the **`DBMS_CLOUD_NOTIFICATION.SEND_MESSAGE`** procedure to send a message to your Slack channel. For more information, see [SEND_MESSAGE Procedure](https://docs.oracle.com/en/cloud/paas/autonomous-database/serverless/adbsb/autonomous-dbms-cloud-notification.html#GUID-8A557984-BEC3-4F82-909E-4451E86F66E0).

1. Copy and paste the following code into your SQL Worksheet, enter your **Channel ID**, and then click the **Run Script (F5)**.


    ```
    <copy>
    BEGIN
      DBMS_CLOUD_NOTIFICATION.SEND_MESSAGE(
        provider          => 'slack',
        credential_name   => 'SLACK_CRED',
        message           => 'Alert from Autonomous Database...',
        params            => json_object('channel' value 'C0....08'));
     END;

    </copy>
    ```

    ![Open ADB](./images/send-a-msg.png "")

2. Open your Slack channel, and confirm the receipt of the message.

    ![Open ADB](./images/check-to-see-msg.png "")

    > **Note:** Use the **params** parameter to specify the Slack channel. The Channel ID is unique ID for a channel and is different from the channel name. You can find your channel ID at the bottom of the channel page.

3. Select your channel, click **Get Channel Details**, scroll down to the bottom section, and then copy the **Channel ID**.

    ![Open ADB](./images/copy-channel-id.png "")

## Task 7: Send query results to a Slack Channel

After creating required credential and configuration, you can use the **`DBMS_CLOUD_NOTIFICATION.SEND_DATA`** procedure to send the output of a query to your Slack channel. For more information, see [`SEND_DATA Procedure`](https://docs.oracle.com/en/cloud/paas/autonomous-database/serverless/adbsb/autonomous-dbms-cloud-notification.html#GUID-B3375A5B-79B1-43A5-B043-A7FA646FBF54).

1. Copy your **Channel ID** from Task 6 (step 3).

2. Copy and paste the following code into your SQL Worksheet, enter your **Channel ID**, and then click the Run Script (F5).

    ```
    <copy>
    BEGIN
      DBMS_CLOUD_NOTIFICATION.SEND_DATA(
        provider => 'slack',
        credential_name => 'SLACK_CRED',
        query => 'SELECT username, account_status, expiry_date FROM USER_USERS WHERE rownum < 3',
        params => json_object('channel' value 'C0....08',
                            'type' value 'csv'));
     END;
    </copy>
    ```

    ![Open ADB](./images/send-sqlquery.png "")

    > **Note:** To specify the output type, use **params** section. Valid output types include `csv` and `json`.

3. Open your Slack channel, and confirm the receipt of query result.

    ![Open ADB](./images/confirm-sql-output.png "")

## Summary
