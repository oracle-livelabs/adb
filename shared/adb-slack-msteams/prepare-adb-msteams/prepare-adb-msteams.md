# Send Microsoft Teams Notifications from Autonomous Database

**Important:** This lab uses features which are not available on the Oracle LiveLabs Sandbox hosted environments (the Green button), and requires Microsoft Teams admin permissions. If you run this lab using a LiveLabs Sandbox environment, you can only review the steps and later practice the steps using your organizationâ€™s Microsoft Teams workspace.

## Introduction

Microsoft Teams serves as a comprehensive collaboration platform within the Microsoft 365 ecosystem, facilitating instant messaging, audio and video calls, and online meetings. With its seamless integration with other applications, Teams enhances productivity by streamlining communication and project management. Microsoft Teams supports a wide range of integrations with external apps and services.

This lab walks you through the steps to configure your Microsoft Teams application to receive messages, alerts and output of a query from Autonomous Database. Also, you will learn the procedures to send Microsoft Teams notifications.

Estimated Time: 25 minutes

5. After replacing parameters, click the **Run Script (F5)** icon in the Worksheet toolbar.

    ```
    <copy>
       BEGIN
          DBMS_CLOUD.CREATE_CREDENTIAL(credential_name => 'TEAMS_CRED',
                    username        => 'bot_id',
                    password        => 'bot_secret');
       END;

    ```

    ![Open ADB](./images/create_credential.png "")

    > **Note:** To use Microsoft Teams app with **`DBMS_CLOUD_NOTIFICATION`** procedure, you need to run the procedure successfully. If you can not run the **`CREATE_CREDENTIAL`** procedure successfully, you can consult the ADMIN user to grant execute access on **`DBMS_CLOUD`** packages.

## Task 7: Send messages to a Microsoft Teams Channel

After creating the Microsoft Teams credential object, you can use the **`DBMS_CLOUD_NOTIFICATION.SEND_MESSAGE`** procedure to send a message to your Microsoft Teams channel.

1. Copy and paste the following code into your SQL Worksheet, and enter your **Team ID**, then click the **Run Script (F5)**.

    ```

             credential_name => 'TEAMS_CRED',
             message         => 'text from new teams api',
             params          => json_object('channel' value 'teamID'));
        END;
    </copy>
    ```

    ![Open ADB](./images/run_send_notif_pkg.png "")

2. Open your Teams channel, and confirm the receipt of the message.

    ![Open ADB](./images/confirm_msg.png "")

## Task 8: Send query results to a Microsoft Teams Channel

After creating required credential and configuration, you can use the **`DBMS_CLOUD_NOTIFICATION.SEND_DATA`** procedure to send the output of a query to your Microsoft Teams Channel.

1. Copy and paste the following code into your SQL Worksheet, enter the following parameters, and then click the **Run Script (F5)**.

    - Tenant: Enter your  **tenant ID**
    - Team: Enter your **team ID**
    - Channel: Enter **channel ID**
    - Title: Enter your preferred **title of the file**
    - Type: Output format can be `csv` or `json`

    ```
     <copy>
      BEGIN
          DBMS_CLOUD_NOTIFICATION.SEND_DATA(provider => 'msteams',
             credential_name => 'TEAMS_CRED',
             query           => 'SELECT tablespace_name FROM dba_tablespaces',
             params          => json_object('tenant'value '5b743bc******c0286',
                                       'team'value '0ae401*********5d2bd',
                                       'channel'value '19%3a94be023*****%40thread.tacv2',
                                       'title'value 'today',
                                       'type'value 'csv'));
        END;
     </copy>
    ```

    ![Open ADB](./images/send_results_query.png "")

    > **Note:** The maximum file size supported when using `DBMS_CLOUD_NOTIFICATION.SEND_DATA` for Microsoft Teams is `4MB`.

2. Open your Teams channel, and confirm the receipt of the query result.

    ![Open ADB](./images/confirm_query_result.png "")
