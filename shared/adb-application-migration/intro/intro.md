# Introduction

## **About this Workshop**

Application migration is the complex process of moving an application from one environment to another. This process involves a series of steps, including migrating SQL statements as the statements transition from a non-Oracle database to an Oracle database. Each step of the migration must be performed carefully to ensure that the application functions seamlessly in the new environment.
The purpose of this workshop is to introduce you to the `DBMS_CLOUD_MIGRATION` package. The `DBMS_CLOUD_MIGRATION` package facilitates you to easily migrate applications to Autonomous Database, when the applications were developed for non-Oracle databases that use a different SQL flavor.

Estimated Workshop Time: 90 minutes

**<i>Note: At present, the `DBMS_CLOUD_MIGRATION` package supports the migration of SQL statements written in <b>PostgreSQL</b>, <b>MySQL</b> and <b>SQL Server</b>. This workshop demonstrates translation and migration of the SQL statements from PostgreSQL to Oracle SQL.</i>**


### **Objectives**

- Provision an Oracle Autonomous Database
- Connect to the Oracle Autonomous Database using the SQL Worksheet
- Connect to the Oracle Autonomous Database using the SQL Developer
- Translate individual SQL statements from a non-Oracle database to Oracle SQL
- Run PostgreSQL Statements in Autonomous Database
- Translate PostgreSQL files to Oracle SQL

### **Prerequisites**

This workshop requires an Oracle Cloud account. You may use your existing account or create one in the following lab.

**<i>Note: If you have a Free Trial Oracle Cloud account, when your Free Trial expires your Oracle Cloud account will be converted to an Always Free Oracle Cloud account. You will not be able to conduct Free Tier workshops unless the Always Free environment is available.**

Let's begin! If you need to create an Oracle Cloud account, please click Get Started in the Contents menu on the left. Otherwise, if you have an existing Oracle Cloud account, click "Create an Autonomous Database".</i>
