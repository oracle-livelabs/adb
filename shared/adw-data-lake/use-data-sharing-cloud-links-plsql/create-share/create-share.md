# Create, Populate, and Publish a Data Share

## Introduction

A data share is a named entity in the providerâ€™s instance. It can be a group of datasets shared as a single entity. The share is the logical container that contains objects such as tables that you will share with recipients. An authorized data share recipient can  access the share and all the tables in it.

In this lab, as a share provider user, you will create a data share and add a table to it. Next, you will publish the data share to make it available to the authorized recipient that you will define in the next lab.

Estimated Time: 15 minutes

### Objectives

In this lab, you will:

* Create a new data share.
* Create two tables.
* Add one of the newly created tables to the data share.
* Publish the data share to make it available to authorized recipients.

### Prerequisites

This lab assumes that you have successfully completed all of the preceding labs in the **Contents** menu on the left.

## Task 1: Create a Data Share

1. As the **`share_provider`** user, create a new data share named **`demo_share`**. The **`DATA_SHARE_STORAGE_LINK`** value refers to the storage link that you created in **Lab 2** which points to your Object Storage bucket's URI. Copy and paste the following script into your SQL Worksheet, and then click the **Run Script** icon in the Worksheet toolbar.

    ```
    <copy>
    BEGIN
    DBMS_SHARE.CREATE_SHARE(
        share_name=>'demo_live_share',
        share_type=>'LIVE');
    END;
    /
    </copy>
    ```

    ![Create data share.](images/create-data-share.png)

    >**Note:** To drop a share, use the `DBMS_SHARE.DROP_SHARE` procedure as follows:

    ```
    BEGIN
        DBMS_SHARE.DROP_SHARE('demo_live_share');
    END;
    /
    ```

2. Verify the creation of the data share. Copy and paste the following script into your SQL Worksheet, and then click the **Run Statement** icon in the Worksheet toolbar.

    ```
    <copy>
    SELECT share_name, current_version
    FROM user_shares
    WHERE share_name='DEMO_LIVE_SHARE';
    </copy>
    ```

    ![Query new data share.](images/query-data-share.png)

    Before you publish the data share, the **Current Version** column shows **`(null)`**. After you publish the data share, the the **Current Version** column will show **`1`**.

## Task 2: Create Tables to Add to the Data Share

1. Create an external table from a public dataset that you will add to the data share. The **moviestream_landing** Oracle Object Storage public bucket that contains some `Parquet` data is located in a different tenancy than yours, **`c4u04`**; therefore, you will use the following public URL. Copy and paste the following script into your SQL Worksheet, and then click the **Run Script** icon in the Worksheet toolbar.

    ```
    <copy>
    BEGIN
        DBMS_CLOUD.CREATE_EXTERNAL_TABLE(
        table_name =>'custsales_external',
        file_uri_list =>'https://objectstorage.us-ashburn-1.oraclecloud.com/n/c4u04/b/moviestream_landing/o/sales_sample/*.parquet',
        format =>  '{"type":"parquet", "schema": "first"}');
    END;
    /
    </copy>
    ```

    ![Create external table.](images/create-external-table.png)

2. Create a table based on the external table which you will add to the data share. Copy and paste the following script into your SQL Worksheet, and then click the **Run Script** icon in the Worksheet toolbar.

    ```
    <copy>
    CREATE TABLE custsales
    AS
        SELECT *
        FROM custsales_external;
    </copy>
    ```

    ![Create heap table.](images/create-heap-table.png)

3. Query the newly created **`custsales`** table. Copy and paste the following script into your SQL Worksheet, and then click the **Run Statement** icon.

    ```
    <copy>
    SELECT app, count(*)
    FROM custsales
    GROUP BY app
    ORDER BY 1;
    </copy>
    ```

    ![Query new data share.](images/query-custsales.png)

## Task 3: Add the custsales Table to the Data Share

1. Add the `custsales` table to the `demo_share` data share. Copy and paste the following script into your SQL Worksheet, and then click the **Run Script** icon in the Worksheet toolbar.

    ```
    <copy>
    BEGIN
    DBMS_SHARE.ADD_TO_SHARE(
        share_name=>'demo_live_share',
        owner=> 'share_provider',
        table_name=> 'custsales',
        share_table_name=> 'custsales');
    END;
    /
    </copy>
    ```

    ![Add table to share.](images/add-table-share.png)

2. Verify the addition of the table to the data share. Copy and paste the following script into your SQL Worksheet, and then click the **Run Statement** icon.

    ```
    <copy>
    SELECT share_table_name, table_name, table_owner
    FROM user_share_tables
    WHERE share_name='DEMO_LIVE_SHARE'
    ORDER BY 1;
    </copy>
    ```

    ![Verify table addition.](images/verify-table-added.png)

    >**Note:** To remove a table from a share, use the following script:

    ```
    BEGIN
    DBMS_SHARE.REMOVE_FROM_SHARE(
        share_name=>'demo_live_share',
        share_table_name => 'custsales'
    );
    END;
    ```

## Task 4: Publish the Data Share

Up to this point, the share and its table are stored in the database and therefore are not yet available to anyone. In this task, you will call the `PUBLISH_SHARE` API which offloads data to the Cloud Store and makes it accessible to recipients that you define and authorize in a later lab.

1. Publish the `demo_share` data share to make it visible to authorized recipients. To ensure that the publishing job is complete before you move on to the next lab, you will use the `PUBLISH_SHARE_WAIT` procedure. It also makes a share visible to authorized recipients; however, it waits for the publishing task to complete. Copy and paste the following script into your SQL Worksheet, and then click the **Run Script** icon. It could take few minutes for the publishing process (export) to complete.

    ```
    <copy>
    BEGIN
        DBMS_SHARE.PUBLISH_SHARE_WAIT(share_name=>'demo_live_share');
    END;
    /
    </copy>
    ```

    ![Publish the share.](images/publish-share.png)

2. Use the `user_share_versions` view to track the state of the export. Copy and paste the following script into your SQL Worksheet, and then click the **Run Statement** icon.

    ```
    <copy>
    SELECT SHARE_NAME, SHARE_VERSION, STATUS
    FROM user_share_versions v
    WHERE v.share_name = 'DEMO_LIVE_SHARE'
    ORDER BY share_version desc;
    </copy>
    ```

    ![Track the data export.](images/track-export.png)

    If the **STATUS** shows **EXPORTING**, that indicates the publishing process is not yet complete. You might have to wait for a few minutes for the publishing to finish. Don't proceed to the next lab until the **STATUS** shows **CURRENT**.

You may now proceed to the next lab.
