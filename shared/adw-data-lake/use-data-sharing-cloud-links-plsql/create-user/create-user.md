Estimated Time: 15 minutes

### Objectives

In this lab, you will:

* Create a user that will be the data share provider.
* Grant the data share provider the necessary role and privileges.
* Enable data sharing for the schema.

### Prerequisites

This lab assumes that you have successfully completed all of the preceding labs in the **Contents** menu on the left.

## Task 1: Navigate to the SQL Worksheet

<if type="livelabs">
Your green button reservation includes an ADB instance. You can find the required credentials in the **Reservation Information** dialog box for your reservation. To log in to the Console, click the **Launch OCI** button in the **Reservation Information** dialog box, and then follow the prompts to reset your assigned password.

</if>

1. Log in to the **Oracle Cloud Console**, if you are not already logged in; otherwise, skip to step 4.

2. Open the **Navigation** menu and click **Oracle Database**. Under **Oracle Database**, click **Autonomous Database**.

<if type="livelabs">
    > **_Important: At the time of updating this workshop (July 15, 2025), there is a known issue with OCI and using the sandbox environment reservations (the green button). The old Autonomous Databases UI page is displayed instead of the new Redwood UI page._**

    ![The old Autonomous Databases page.](images/old-adb-page.png =65%x*)

    To correct this issue, simply click **Reload this page** icon in your browser. The newly designed **Autonomous Databases** page is displayed. 
    
    >**Note:** The **Couldn't load data** error on the page is due to being in the wrong compartment. You will learn how to navigate to your assigned compartment next. 

    ![Forbidden error.](images/forbidden-error.png =65%x*)

    OCI resources are organized into compartments. To navigate to your assigned sandbox reservation compartment, click the **Compartment** field. Next, enter your assigned compartment name (or partial name) from the **Reservation Information** page in the **Compartment** text box. Once your assigned compartment is displayed in the drop-down list under the **`Livelabs`** node, click it.
    
    ![Select your assigned compartment.](images/ll-select-compartment.png =65%x*)

    >**Note:** For more details on finding your assigned resources in your reservation such as the username, password, compartment and so on, review the **Get Started with LiveLabs** lab in the Navigation menu on the left.

    
</if>

3. On the **Autonomous Databases** page, click your **ADW-Data-Lake** ADB instance.

    <if type="freetier">
    ![The Autonomous Database is displayed and highlighted.](./images/adb-page.png =65%x*)
    </if>

    <if type="livelabs">
    ![The Autonomous Database is displayed and highlighted.](./images/ll-adb-page.png =65%x*)

    >**Note:** Since you are using a Sandbox environment, an ADB instance was created for you. To view the ADB instance details, click the **View Login Info** link to display the **Reservation Information** dialog box. The database admin password, database name, and database display name are displayed.

    </if>

    ![The SQL worksheet is displayed.](./images/sql-worksheet.png " ")

## Task 2: Create a Share Provider User and Grant Privileges to the User

As the **`admin`** user, create a **share_provider** user and grant this user the required role and privileges and enable REST and data sharing.

### **The Data Share Provider**

Oracle Autonomous Database Serverless enables the data share provider to share existing objects such as tables with authorized recipients. The share can contain a single table, a set of related tables, a set of tables with some logical grouping. The provider could be a person, an institution, or a software system that shares the objects.

Autonomous Database comes with a predefined database role named `DWROLE`. This role provides the privileges necessary for most database users;however, The DWROLE role does not allocate any tablespace quota to the user. If the user is going to be adding data or other objects, you need to grant the user tablespace quota. For more information about this role, see [Manage Database User Privileges](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/autonomous-database/doc/managing-database-users.html).

1. Create a **share_provider** user and grant this user the required role and privileges and enable REST and data sharing. Copy and paste the following script into your SQL Worksheet, and then click the **Run Script (F5)** icon in the Worksheet toolbar.

    ```
    <copy>
    -- Create a new user that will provide the shared data.

    CREATE USER share_provider IDENTIFIED BY DataShare4ADW;

    -- Grant the new user the required role and privileges.

    GRANT CONNECT TO share_provider;
    GRANT DWROLE TO share_provider;
    GRANT RESOURCE TO share_provider;
    GRANT UNLIMITED TABLESPACE TO share_provider;

    -- Enable REST.

    BEGIN
        ORDS_ADMIN.ENABLE_SCHEMA(
            p_enabled => TRUE,
            p_schema => 'SHARE_PROVIDER',
            p_url_mapping_type => 'BASE_PATH',
            p_url_mapping_pattern => 'share_provider',
            p_auto_rest_auth=> TRUE
        );

    -- Enable data sharing.
        DBMS_SHARE.ENABLE_SCHEMA(
        SCHEMA_NAME => 'SHARE_PROVIDER',
        ENABLED => TRUE
        );
       commit;
    END;
    /
    </copy>
    ```

    ![Run the script](images/run-script.png)

    The results are displayed in the **Script Output** tab.

    ![View the script results](images/script-results.png)

## Task 3: Get the Consumer's Share ID and the Share Provider User Information

1. As the **`ADMIN`** user, get the consumer's Share ID. The Data Provider intends to share data with some Oracle ADB. To identify the data consumer, you need to get the **Sharing ID**. Copy and paste the following script into your SQL Worksheet, and then click the **Run Statement** icon in the Worksheet toolbar.

    ```
    <copy>
    SELECT dbms_share.get_sharing_id
    FROM dual;
    </copy>
    ```

    ![Determine the consumer share id](images/get-sharing-id.png)

2. Copy the **`get_sharing_id`** value to a text editor of your choice. You will need this value later. Right-click the **`get_sharing_id`** value, and then click **Copy** from the context.

    ![Copy the sharing id value](images/copy-sharing-id.png)

    Copy the value and paste it into your text editor file.

    ![Paste the value into a text editor file](images/copy-value-text-editor.png =70%x*)

3. Log out of the **`ADMIN`** user. On the **Oracle Database Actions | SQL** banner, click the drop-down list next to the **`ADMIN`** user, and then select **Sign Out** from the drop-down menu. When prompted if you want to leave the site, click **Leave**.

    ![Log out of admin](images/logout-admin.png)

4. Log in as the newly created user, **`share_provider`**. On the **Sign-in** page, enter **`share_provider`** as the username and **`DataShare4ADW`** as the password, and then click **Sign in**.

    ![Log in as share_provider](images/login-share-provider.png =50%x*)

    You are now logged in as the newly created **`share_provider`** user. On the Launchpad, click the **Development** tab, and then click the **SQL** tab.

    ![Logged in as share_provider](images/logged-share-provider.png)

    The SQL Worksheet is displayed. If an information box is displayed, close it.

    ![The SQL Worksheet is displayed for the share_provider user](images/share-provider-worksheet.png)


5. Provide the share provider user identity information. This enables consumers to see this share provider user and the user's shared data. This is a free form metadata. Provide a meaningful **name**, **description**, and an **email** address. Copy and paste the following script into your SQL Worksheet, and then click the **Run Script (F5)** icon in the Worksheet toolbar.

    ```
    <copy>
    BEGIN
    dbms_share.set_published_identity(SYS.JSON_OBJECT_T(JSON_OBJECT(
        -- A name that will be visible to recipients.
        -- Give enough information to be identifiable
        'name' VALUE 'LIVE_SHARE_PROVIDER_'
        || SYS_CONTEXT('USERENV', 'CON_NAME') || '/' || USER,
        'description' VALUE 'Live Share Provider',
        'contact' VALUE 'provider@example.com')));
    END;
    /
    </copy>
    ```

    ![Run the script](images/identify-share-provider.png)

6. Query the share provider user identity information. Copy and paste the following query into your SQL Worksheet, and then click the **Run Script (F5)** icon.

    ```
    <copy>
    SELECT *
    FROM JSON_TABLE(
    dbms_share.get_published_identity, '$'
    COLUMNS (name, description, contact));
    </copy>
    ```

    ![Query the credentials](images/query-identity.png)

You may now proceed to the next lab.
