# Create a Share Provider User and Grant the User Privileges

## Introduction

In this lab, you as the **`admin`**, you will create a **data share provider** user and grant this user the necessary role and privileges, and enable data sharing.

Estimated Time: 15 minutes

### Objectives

In this lab, you will:

* Create a user that will be the data share provider.
* Grant the data share provider the necessary role and privileges.
* Enable data sharing for the schema.

### Prerequisites

This lab assumes that you have successfully completed all of the preceding labs in the **Contents** menu on the left.

## Task 1: Navigate to the SQL Worksheet

1. Log in to the **Oracle Cloud Console**, if you are not already logged in.

2. Open the **Navigation** menu and click **Oracle Database**. Under **Oracle Database**, click **Autonomous Database**.

3. On the **Autonomous Databases** page, click your **ADW-Data-Lake** ADB instance.
    ![The Autonomous Database is displayed and highlighted.](./images/adb-page.png " ")

4. On the **Autonomous Database details** page, click the **Database actions** drop-down list, and then click **SQL**.

    ![On the partial Autonomous Database Details page, the Database Actions button is highlighted.](./images/click-db-actions.png " ")

5. The SQL Worksheet is displayed.

## Task 2: Create a Share Provider User and Grant Privileges to the User

As the **`admin`** user, create a **share_provider** user and grant this user the required role and privileges and enable REST and data sharing.

### **The Data Share Provider**

Oracle Autonomous Database Serverless enables the data share provider to share existing objects such as tables with authorized recipients. The share can contain a single table, a set of related tables, a set of tables with some logical grouping. The provider could be a person, an institution, or a software system that shares the objects.

Autonomous Database comes with a predefined database role named `DWROLE`. This role provides the privileges necessary for most database users;however, The DWROLE role does not allocate any tablespace quota to the user. If the user is going to be adding data or other objects, you need to grant the user tablespace quota. For more information about this role, see [Manage Database User Privileges](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/autonomous-database/doc/managing-database-users.html).

1. Create a **share_provider** user and grant this user the required role and privileges and enable REST and data sharing. Copy and paste the following script into your SQL Worksheet, and then click the **Run Script (F5)** icon in the Worksheet toolbar.

    ```
    <copy>
    -- Create a new user that will provide the shared data.

    CREATE USER share_provider IDENTIFIED BY DataShare4ADW;

    -- Grant the new user the required role and privileges.

    GRANT CONNECT TO share_provider;
    GRANT DWROLE TO share_provider;
    GRANT RESOURCE TO share_provider;
    GRANT UNLIMITED TABLESPACE TO share_provider;

    -- Enable REST.

    BEGIN
        ORDS_ADMIN.ENABLE_SCHEMA(
            p_enabled => TRUE,
            p_schema => 'SHARE_PROVIDER',
            p_url_mapping_type => 'BASE_PATH',
            p_url_mapping_pattern => 'share_provider',
            p_auto_rest_auth=> TRUE
        );

    -- Enable data sharing.
        DBMS_SHARE.ENABLE_SCHEMA(
        SCHEMA_NAME => 'SHARE_PROVIDER',
        ENABLED => TRUE
        );
       commit;
    END;
    /
    </copy>
    ```

    ![Run the script](images/run-script.png)

    The results are displayed in the **Script Output** tab.

    ![View the script results](images/script-results.png)

## Task 3: Get the Consumer's Share ID and the Share Provider User Information

1. As the **`ADMIN`** user, get the consumer's Share ID. The Data Provider intends to share data with some Oracle ADB. To identify the data consumer, you need to get the **Sharing ID**. Copy and paste the following script into your SQL Worksheet, and then click the **Run Statement** icon in the Worksheet toolbar.

    ```
    <copy>
    SELECT dbms_share.get_sharing_id
    FROM dual;
    </copy>
    ```

    ![Determine the consumer share id](images/get-sharing-id.png)

2. Copy the **`get_sharing_id`** value to a text editor of your choice. You will need this value later. Click the **eye** icon. The **`get_sharing_id`** value is highlighted.

    ![Copy the sharing id value](images/copy-sharing-id.png)

    Copy the value and paste it into your text editor file.

    ![Paste the value into a text editor file](images/copy-value-text-editor.png)

3. Log out of the **`ADMIN`** user. On the **Oracle Database Actions | SQL** banner, click the drop-down list next to the **`ADMIN`** user, and then select **Sign Out** from the drop-down menu. When prompted if you want to leave the site, click **Leave**.

    ![Log out of admin](images/logout-admin.png)

4. Log in as the newly created user, **`share_provider`**. On the **Sign-in** page, enter **`share_provider`** as the username and **`DataShare4ADW`** as the password, and then click **Sign in**.

    ![Log in as share_provider](images/login-share-provider.png)

    You are now logged in as the newly created **`share_provider`** user. In the **Development** section, click the **SQL** card to display the SQL Worksheet.

    ![Logged in as share_provider](images/logged-share-provider.png)

5. Provide the share provider user identity information. This enables consumers to see this share provider user and the user's shared data. This is a free formed metadata. Provide a meaningful **name**, **description**, and an **email** address. Copy and paste the following script into your SQL Worksheet, and then click the **Run Script (F5)** icon in the Worksheet toolbar.

    ```
    <copy>
    BEGIN
    dbms_share.set_published_identity(SYS.JSON_OBJECT_T(JSON_OBJECT(
        -- A name that will be visible to recipients.
        -- Give enough information to be identifiable
        'name' VALUE 'LIVE_SHARE_PROVIDER_'
        || SYS_CONTEXT('USERENV', 'CON_NAME') || '/' || USER,
        'description' VALUE 'Live Share Provider',
        'contact' VALUE 'provider@example.com')));
    END;
    /
    </copy>
    ```

    ![Run the script](images/identify-share-provider.png)

6. Query the share provider user identity information. Copy and paste the following query into your SQL Worksheet, and then click the **Run Script (F5)** icon.

    ```
    <copy>
    SELECT *
    FROM JSON_TABLE(
    dbms_share.get_published_identity, '$'
    COLUMNS (name, description, contact));
    </copy>
    ```

    ![Query the credentials](images/query-identity.png)

You may now proceed to the next lab.
