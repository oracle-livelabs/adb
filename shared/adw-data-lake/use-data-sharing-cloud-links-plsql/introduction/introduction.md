# Introduction

<!--- comment --->

Data sharing enables you to share the same data with one or more consumers. Sharing data and consuming data from external sources enables collaboration with partners, establishes new partnerships, and generates new revenue streams with data monetization. The Oracle Data Sharing for general recipients is based on the open _delta sharing standard protocol_, providing a simple REST-based API to share data in `Parquet` format. In addition, you can implement data sharing using Database Actions in Autonomous Database (ADB) using Cloud links.

Data is made accessible by the data sharing provider (such as Oracle Autonomous Database) to the data sharing recipient (such as Microsoft Power BI) at query time in `Parquet` format. The provider can only share data which they have access to when they log into an ADB instance. The parquet files are physically stored in an OCI bucket or use the bucket to store live share parquet files to cache them and improve performance.

## About this Workshop

There are several methods to set up and consume data sharing using:

* PL/SQL scripts using delta sharing protocol
* PL/SQL scripts using Cloud links **(covered in this workshop)**
* Database Actions in Autonomous Database (ADB) using delta sharing protocol
* Database Actions in Autonomous Database (ADB) using Cloud links

Estimated Time: 1 hour

### Objectives

In this workshop, you will:

* Set up the workshop environment
* Create a data share provider user that creates and manages the data share and the recipients of the data share
* Grant the share provider user the necessary privileges
* Obtain the data consumer Share ID
* Identify the share provider
* Verify the identity credentials
* Create, verify, populate, and publish a data share
* Create and authorize a data share recipient
* Create a data share consumer and consume the data as a recipient using a cloud link

### Prerequisites

* An Oracle account

### Traditional Methods to Share Data

Some examples of how users traditionally shared data are:

* Send data via email
* Share data through an FTP server
* Use application-specific APIs for data extraction
* Leverage vendor specific tools to copy relevant data

While the traditional methods work in general, they come with certain _drawbacks_:

* Managing separate processes for data extraction, preparation or remote access are labor-intensive.
* Extracting and duplicating data is prone to data staleness.
* Architectures and processes can become very difficult to maintain and hard to scale.
* Redundant data extraction can introduce format compatibility issues.
* Data extraction and preparation must handle sensitive information properly.

### The Modern Way for Sharing Data

Modern data sharing must be open, secure, real-time, vendor-agnostic, and avoid the pitfalls of extracting and duplicating data for individual consumers of data in a collaborative environment. Delta Sharing is an open protocol for secure real-time data exchange of large datasets that satisfies all these criteria, supported by multiple clients and program languages, and vendor agnostic.

Data sharing is aimed to solve the following problems:

* Share data without copying it to another system
* Producer controls the state of data (version of data)
* Be an open cross-platform solution
* Support a wide range of clients such as Power BI, Tableau, Apache Spark, pandas and Java
* Provide flexibility to consume data using the tools of choice for BI, machine learning and AI use cases
* Provide strong security, auditing, and governance
* Scale to massive data sets

**Important:**    
In this workshop, you will assume the responsibilities of several users. Initially, you will log in as the default ADB **`admin`** user to create a **`share_provider`** user, a **`share_consumer`** user, and to perform various administration tasks. The **`share_provider`** user creates a data share recipient named **`live_share_oracle_user`**. In various labs, you will log in as either the **`share_provider`** user or the **`share_consumer`** user to perform the appropriate tasks associated with those users.

**_In real use cases, there will be different users performing different responsibilities._**

### How Does Cloud Links Data Sharing Work?

At the high level, sharing data using cloud links works as follows:

* The share provider user creates and publishes a data share that can be shared with one or more recipients.
* The share provider user creates and authorizes recipients.
* The recipient uses the share provider's id to discover the available data shares and tables.
* The recipient subscribes to the data share provider, retrieves data from the data share, and creates a share link and a view using the data share table.

You may now proceed to the next lab.
