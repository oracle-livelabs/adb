# Introduction

## About this Workshop

There are several methods to set up and consume data sharing using:

* PL/SQL scripts in Autonomous Database (ADB) using delta sharing protocol
* PL/SQL scripts in Autonomous Database (ADB) using Cloud links
* Data Studio in Autonomous Database (ADB) using delta sharing protocol
* _Data Studio in Autonomous Database (ADB) using Cloud links_ _**(covered in this workshop)**_

<!--- comment --->

Data sharing enables you to share the same data with one or more consumers. Sharing data and consuming data from external sources enables collaboration with partners, establishes new partnerships, and generates new revenue streams with data monetization.

Estimated Workshop Time: 1 hour

### Objectives

In this workshop, you will:

* Set up the workshop environment
* Create a data share provider user that creates and manages the data share and the recipients of the data share
* Create, populate, and publish a data share
* Create and authorize a data share recipient
* Create a data share consumer
* Subscribe to the share provider and consume the data as a recipient

### Prerequisites

* An Oracle account

### Traditional Methods to Share Data

Some examples of how users traditionally shared data are:

* Send data via email
* Share data through an FTP server
* Use application-specific APIs for data extraction
* Leverage vendor specific tools to copy relevant data

While the traditional methods work in general, they come with certain _drawbacks_:

* Managing separate processes for data extraction, preparation or remote access are labor-intensive.
* Extracting and duplicating data is prone to data staleness.
* Architectures and processes can become very difficult to maintain and hard to scale.
* Redundant data extraction can introduce format compatibility issues.
* Data extraction and preparation must handle sensitive information properly.

### The Modern Way for Sharing Data

Modern data sharing must be open, secure, real-time, vendor-agnostic, and avoid the pitfalls of extracting and duplicating data for individual consumers of data in a collaborative environment. Delta Sharing is an open protocol for secure real-time data exchange of large datasets that satisfies all these criteria, supported by multiple clients and program languages, and vendor agnostic.

**Important:**    
In this workshop, you will assume the responsibilities of several users. Initially, you will log in as the default ADB **`admin`** user to create a **`share_provider`** user, a **`share_consumer`** user, and to perform various administration tasks. The **`share_provider`** user creates a data share recipient named **`training_recipient`**. In various labs, you will log in as either the **`share_provider`** user or the **`share_consumer`** user to perform the appropriate tasks associated with those users.

**_In real use cases, there will be different users performing different responsibilities._**

### How Does Live Data Sharing Work?

At the high level, live data sharing works as follows:

* The share provider user creates and publishes a data share that can be shared with one or more recipients.
* The share provider user creates and authorizes recipients.
* The recipient subscribes to the data share provider.
* The recipient retrieves (consumers) data from the live data share.

You may now proceed to the next lab.
