# Consume the Data Share by the Recipient

## Introduction

In this lab you will learn how to consume the data in your available data share as a recipient.

Estimated Time: 10 minutes

### Objectives

In this lab, you will:

* Subscribe to the data share provider.
* Access the data in your authorized data share.

### Prerequisites

* This lab assumes that you have successfully completed all of the preceding labs in the **Contents** menu on the left.

Live data shared with you through data sharing is not automatically available for consumption. To consume data shares, you as a recipient need to subscribe to them and create views of the tables included in the live share. This enables the recipient to consume live data from the database.

## Task 1: Log in as the share_consumer User

1. Log in as the **`share_consumer`** user. On the **Sign-in** page, enter **`share_consumer`** as the username and **`TrainingADW`** as the password, and then click **Sign in**.

2. On the **Database Actions Launchpad** page, click the **Data Studio** tab, and then click the **Data Share** tab.

    A **`CUSTOMER_CONTACT_SHARE` share provider was created successfully**  informational message is displayed. You are directed to the **Link Data** page with the **Share** tab selected. The **`share_consumer`** user now has access to the **`training_share`** data share that was created by the **`share_provider`** user. Drill-down on **`training_share`** to see the **`CUSTOMER_CONTACT`** table in this share.

## Task 3: Create a View over the Shared Table

In this task, you create a view based on the **`CUSTOMER_CONTACT`** table that was included in the live data share. A view is a logical table based on one or more tables or views. A view contains no data itself. The tables upon which a view is based are called base tables.

1. Click the drop-down list and select the **`TRAINING_SHARE`**, if needed. You might need to click the **Refresh** icon to display the **`TRAINING_SHARE`**. Drill-down on the **`TRAINING_SHARE`** data share node to display the objects in it. Drag and drop the **`CUSTOMER_CONTACT`** shared table to add it to the data link job.

2. The shared table is added to the data link job. When you run this job, a new **`CUSTOMER_CONTACT`** view will be created on top of the **`CUSTOMER_CONTACT`** table that was shared with you. Before you create the view, change its name from **`CUSTOMER_CONTACT`** to **`CUSTOMER_CONTACT_SHARE`**. Click the **Settings** icon (pencil).

3. In the **Link Data from Cloud Store Location SHARE_PROVIDER.CUSTOMER\_CONTACT** dialog box, change the name of the view that will be generated to **`CUSTOMER_CONTACT_SHARE`**, and then click **Close**.

    ![Change the table name.](images/change-table-name.png)

    The **Link Data** page is re-displayed.

    ![The changed table name is displayed.](images/table-name-changed.png)

4. Click **Start**. A **Start Link from Cloud Store** dialog box is displayed. Click **Run**. When the job completes successfully, a link icon is displayed. The **`CUSTOMER_CONTACT_SHARE`** view is created.

    ![The link job is completed.](images/link-job-complete.png)
