# Enhance Data for Analytics Using the Table AI Assist Tool

## Introduction

In this lab, you will use the **Table AI Assist** tool to prepare and enhance data for analytics. You can use this tool to add, remove, and rename columns in a table using AI assistance. This enables you to augment or correct data found in tables in your local schema using natural language AI prompts. You can add columns for day, month, quarter and year using data in a date column or add a distance column from two columns with geographical co-ordinates.

For example you can derive separate columns from a single date column for time-based reporting, or calculate the distance between two geographical co-ordinates and add that as a new column. The Table AI Assist tool works by using your configured AI profile to generate SQL to prepare your data. The output of the tool can then be a new view on top of your source table, or a new table.

You can prepare data using the Table AI Assist Tool by performing the following:

* Add, replace, remove, and rename a column
* View Statistical Details about the Table you Load after you Create a Recipe
* View Table Entity Details

You will use the Table AI Assist tool to create recipes. A recipe is a set of steps. Each step lets you add, replace, remove, or rename columns without making any changes to your source table. You add as many steps as you want to a recipe. You can save a recipe to your schema or export it as JSON to a file. You can return back to your saved recipe and keep working on it.

Estimated Time: 10 minutes

    The two tables are created.

    ![The tables are created.](images/tables-created.png " ")

## Task 3: Create a Recipe

**What is a Recipe?**

In this task, you will work with the data preparation tool to create recipes. A recipe is a set of steps. You can use a step to add, replace, remove, and rename columns without making any changes to your base (source) table. You can add as many steps as you want to a recipe. You can then save a recipe to your schema or export it as JSON to a file. You can then return back to your saved recipe and keep working on it as needed.

The following are the different modes of a recipe:

* Create or Replace View
* Create a new table
* Alter table

Once you are satisfied with a recipe you can use it to create or replace a view, create a new table, or alter the table.

1. In the Navigation menu on the left, click **Table AI Assist**.

    ![Click Table AI Assist.](./images/click-ai-assist.png =65%x*)

    The **Table AI Assist SQL Recipes** page is displayed. The tables that you have created so far are displayed.

    ![The Add Step panel is displayed.](./images/add-step-panel.png =60%x*)

4. In the **Enter a prompt in natural language or specify SQL for column** text field, provide some natural language prompt of what you want to do such as **`The email column contains PII. Please replace everything before the @ with ***`**. Next, click **Ask AI**.

    ![Click Ask AI.](./images/click-ask-ai.png =60%x*)

    A new generated **EMAIL_1** column is displayed in the **Data Preview** section. The new column shows the masked PII in the email addresses. Note the generated SQL that performs this operation which you can also edit and run if you are familiar with SQL.

    ![New column created.](./images/new-column-created.png =60%x*)

5. In this case, since you are masking the PII from the email column, select the **Replace Column** option, and then select the **email** column name from the **Column Name to Replace** drop-down list.

    ![Replace email column.](./images/replace-email-column.png =60%x*)

6. Click **Add Step**. The **Edit Recipe** page is re-displayed. Scroll to the right of the table to display the newly added masked email column.

    ![Click Add Step.](./images/replaced-email-column.png " ")

7. Let's perform some demographics operations such as getting the birth year from the **age** column. Click **Add Step**. In the **Enter a prompt in natural language or specify SQL for column** text field, provide some natural language prompt of what you want to do such as **`birth year from the age column`**. Next, click **Ask AI**.

    ![birth year from the age column.](./images/birth-year.png =60%x*)

    The new **BIRTH_YEAR** column is displayed in the **Data Preview** section. The SQL expression that was used to create this column is displayed in the **SQL** field.

8. Click **Add Step**. The **Edit Recipe** page is re-displayed. Scroll to the right of the table to display the newly added **BIRTH_YEAR** column.

    ![Birth Year column is displayed.](./images/birth-year-column.png " ")

9. Let's perform one more data preparation. Click **Add Step**. In the **Enter a prompt in natural language or specify SQL for column** text field, provide some natural language prompt of what you want to do such as **`generation name from the birth year column`**. Next, click **Ask AI**. The new **generation_name** column is displayed in the **Data Preview** section.

    ![generation name from the birth year column.](./images/generation-name-column.png =60%x*)

10. Click **Add Step**. The **Edit Recipe** page is re-displayed. Scroll to the right of the table to display the newly added **GENERATION_NAME** column.

    ![The generation_name column is displayed.](./images/generation-name-column-displayed.png " ")

11. Finally, let's save the modified **customer** table as a new table named **`customer_enhanced`**. Click the **Target Type** drop-down list and select **Create Table**. Change the table name in the **Target Name** field to **`customer_enhanced`**, and then click **Create Table**.

    ![Click Create Table.](./images/click-create-table.png " ")

12. A **Create Table** dialog box is displayed. Click **Yes**.

    ![Create Table dialog box.](./images/click-yes-dialog.png " ")

    A **Confirmation** message box is displayed. The table is created.

    ![Confirmation message box.](./images/confirmation.png =60%x*)

## Task 4: Analyze Data

In this task, you will analyze data using the Analysis tool which enables you to create Analytic Views with multidimensional metadata. You create Analytic Views on top of a fact table with several dimensions and hierarchies. Analytic views refer to tables in the database and allow users to create hierarchies for dimensions. You can also create Analyses and reports using information from the Analytic Views.

You can access the Data Analysis page from the Database Actions Launchpad. Click the **Data Studio** tab and then the **Data Analysis** tab.

![Access the tool from Launchpad.](./images/access-tool-launchpad.png " ")

    ![Click View All.](./images/click-view-all.png " ")

2. Click **custsales**.

    ![Click custsales.](./images/click-custsales.png " ")

    A **Select Schema** informational box is displayed. Close it.

3. The **custsales** query returns **`The given query has returned large data`** error in the **Query Result** section. There is a limit on displaying only one million rows in this window.

    ![custsales error.](./images/custsales-error.png =65%x*)

    The **custsales** table contains around 2.5 million rows.

    ![custsales rows count.](./images/custsales-rows-count.png =65%x*)

4. Add the `Fetch` clause to the `SELECT` statement, and then click **Run**. This will only show the first 10 rows in the table.

    ```sql
    <copy>
    FETCH FIRST 10 ROWS ONLY;
    </copy>
    ```

    ![Run query.](./images/run-query.png " ")

## Task 7: Import a Connection

When you start the Excel add-in, you can create a connection that you can use going forward. The connections feature lets you manage and connect to multiple Autonomous Databases with a single add-in. You can create multiple connections; however, only one connection can remain active at a time. The **Connection** panel lets you connect to the Autonomous Database through a connection where you provide the login credentials and access the Autonomous Database instance. For additional information, 
see [Connection Management
](https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/sql-developer-web/sdwad/connection-management.html).

In this task, you will learn how to import a `.JSON` connection file that you can download from the **Database Actions Launchpad**.

1. Navigate to the **Database Actions Launchpad**.

2. Click the **Downloads** tab, and then click the **Download Microsoft Excel/Google Sheets add-in** tab.

    ![Click Download Excel/Google Sheets add-in.](./images/click-download-excel-addin.png " ")

3. The **Microsoft Excel** tab is selected by default. Click **Download Connection File**.

    ![Click Download add-in.](./images/click-download-connection.png " ")

    A connection file named similar to **`Excel_connection_ukgyxp2x0rqadss_admin.json`** is downloaded to your browser's **Downloads** folder. In our example, `ukgyxp2x0rqadss`is our host name.

4. Return to your Excel Sheet. Click the **Autonomous Database** tab, and then click **Connections** from the **General Actions** section.

    ![Click Connections.](./images/click-connections.png " ")

    The **Oracle Autonomous Database** task pane is displayed.

5. Click the **Manage Connections** drop-down list and select **Import Connection**.

6. In the **Import** section, click the text box to select the downloaded connection file. Navigate to your downloaded file location, and then select it.

7. The new connection is added. Click the checkbox next to the connection name, and then click **Import**.

    ![Click Import.](./images/click-import.png " ")

    An **Imported connections successfully** message is displayed.

    ![Import successful.](./images/import-successful.png " ")

8. Click the **Actions** icon (three vertical dots) in the connection file section, then click **Connect**.

    ![Connect.](./images/click-connect-file.png =50%x*)

9. On the **Sign-in** page, enter your username and password (`admin` user) that you used when you provisioned your ADB instance. Next, click **Sign in**.

    ![Sign in.](./images/sign-in.png " " )

10. On the **Oracle REST Data Services** dialog box, click **Approve** to allow the connection to ADB.

    ![Click Approve.](./images/click-approve.png " " )

11. If the connection is successful, a green checkmark is displayed next to the connection file name.

    ![Connection successful.](./images/connection-successful.png =50%x* )

## Task 8: Run Direct SQL Queries in an Excel Worksheet

Now that you have a connection to your ADB instance, you will run a simple query from the Excel worksheet. The Oracle Autonomous Database for Excel lets you run Direct SQL queries to work with your data in an Excel worksheet. With the add-in, you can create a table and insert, update and delete rows from the existing tables or views. You can view the results in the current worksheet or different worksheets. To run a query using the add-in, run Excel, and create a blank workbook using the standard Excel workbook file format. For additional information, see the [Query an Analytic View in an Excel worksheet](https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/sql-developer-web/sdwad/query-av.html).

1. Make sure you are still connected to your ADB instance in Excel, if not, you'll need to re-connect. In the Excel ribbon, Click the **Autonomous Database** tab. In the **Queries** section on the ribbon, click **Direct Sql**.

    ![Click Direct SQL.](./images/click-direct-sql.png " " )

    The **Direct SQL query** region is displayed in the **Oracle Autonomous Database** task pane. By default, the tables in your schema are displayed. You can click **Views** to display the views in your schema.

    ![Direct SQL Query.](./images/direct-sql-query.png =65%x* )

2. Let's query the **`custsales`** table. Right-click the **`custsales`** table and click **Select** from the context menu.

    > **Note:** You can also query individual columns in the chosen table.

    ![Select custsales.](./images/select-custsales.png =65%x* )

3. The table query is displayed in the **Write a Query** section. Click the **Run** icon to run the SQL query in the query editor.

    ![Run query.](./images/click-run.png =65%x* )

    In the **Select worksheet** section, you can click the **+** button (Create new worksheet) to add a new worksheet. If you'd like to display the results of a new query in the new worksheet, select it from the drop-down menu.

4. The **Get entire results set** dialog box is displayed. Click **No**.

    ![Get entire results set.](./images/click-no.png =65%x* )

5. The **Query Info** section of the worksheet displayed the ADB instance URL, the user, and the table columns. The **Result Data** section displays the query result.

    ![Results set displayed.](./images/result-set.png =65%x* )
