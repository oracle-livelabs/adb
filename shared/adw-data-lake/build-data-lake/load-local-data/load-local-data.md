# Load Data from Local Files

## Introduction

In this lab, you will practice multiple methods for loading and linking to data into an Oracle Autonomous Database (either Oracle Autonomous Data Warehouse or Oracle Autonomous Transaction Processing) using the ADB built-in Database Action tools, or using other Oracle and third party data integration tools.

You can also leave data in place in cloud object storage, and link to it from your Autonomous Database.

> **Note:** While this lab uses Oracle Autonomous Data Warehouse, the steps are identical for loading data into an Oracle Autonomous Transaction Processing database.

Estimated Time: 10 minutes

Watch the video below for a quick walk-through of the lab.

## Task 1: Log in to the Oracle Cloud Console

1. Log in to the **Oracle Cloud Console**, if you are not already logged as the Cloud Administrator. You will complete all the labs in this workshop using this Cloud Administrator. On the **Sign In** page, select your tenancy, enter your username and password, and then click **Sign In**. The **Oracle Cloud Console** Home page is displayed.

</if>

## Task 2: Download .csv Files from the MovieStream Data Lake to your Local Computer

Oracle MovieStream is a fictitious movie streaming service - similar to those that to which you currently subscribe. MovieStream is storing (and linking to) their data across Oracle Object Storage and Autonomous Database. Data is captured from various sources into a landing zone in object storage. This data is then processed (cleansed, transformed and optimized) and stored in a gold zone on object storage. Once the data is curated, it is loaded into an Autonomous Database where it is analyzed by many (and varied) members of the user community.

1. Right-click on each of the links below, and then click **Save link as...** from the context menu to download the files to a folder on your local computer.

    * [Download customer\_segment.csv](https://objectstorage.us-ashburn-1.oraclecloud.com/n/c4u04/b/moviestream_landing/o/customer_segment/customer_segment.csv)
    * [Download customer-extension.csv](https://objectstorage.us-ashburn-1.oraclecloud.com/n/c4u04/b/moviestream_landing/o/customer_extension/customer-extension.csv)

2. Close the Excel files and make a note of your folder location as you will use the two downloaded files in a later task in this lab.

## Task 3: Navigate to the Data Load Page

<if type="livelabs">
1. You should be already logged in to the Console using the instructions in the **Task 1** in this lab.

2. Open the **Navigation** menu and click **Oracle Database**. Under **Oracle Database**, click **Autonomous Database**. The **Autonomous Databases** page should be displayed; however, your assigned resources for this workshop are all in your assigned LiveLabs compartment (that is displayed in the  **Reservation Information** panel) and not in the **root** tenancy. The following expected warning message is displayed.

    ![The Data Load Home page is displayed.](./images/data-load-home.png " ")
</if>

## Task 4: Load Data from the CSV Files Using the LOAD DATA Tool

In this task you will load the two .csv files that you downloaded earlier into two different tables in your Autonomous Database instance.

1. In the **What do you want to do with your data?** section, accept the default selection, **LOAD DATA**.

2. In the **Where is your data?** section, accept the default selection, **LOCAL FILE**, and then click **Next**.

    ![Select LOAD DATA and LOCAL FILE and click Next.](./images/select-load-data-and-local-file.png " ")

3. You can use the **Local Files** page to either drag and drop files to upload, or click **Select Files** to select the files to upload. Click **Select Files**.

    ![Click Select Files.](./images/click-select-files.png " ")

4. In the **Open** dialog box, navigate to the directory that contains the two **.csv** files that you downloaded earlier. Select the *customer\_segment.csv* and *customer\_extension.csv* files.

    ![Select the two files.](./images/open-dialog-box.png " ")

5. When the upload is complete, you can click the **Start** button and then click **Run** to run the data load job; however, we will make a small change to the default table name that will be created for the *customer-extension.csv* file. Click the 3-dot ellipsis icon to the right of *customer-extension.csv* and then click **Settings** from the context menu.

    ![Update the data load job settings.](./images/click-settings.png " ")

6. The **Load Data from Local File customer-extension.csv** page is displayed. Take a moment to examine the preview information and loading options. The tool makes intelligent choices for target table name and its properties. Since this is an initial load, accept the default option of **Create Table** to create the target table in your Autonomous Database. In the mappings section, you can change the target column names, data types, and length/precision.

    ![Examine the editor of the data load job.](./images/preview-table.png " ")

7. Change the table name that will be created from **CUSTOMEREXTENSION** to **CUSTOMER\_EXTENSION**. Click **Close** in the lower right corner of the page.

    ![Examine the editor of the data load job.](./images/change-table-name.png " ")

8. Click **Start**. A **Run Data Load Job** confirmation dialog box is displayed. Click **Run**.

    ![Run the data load.](./images/click-start.png " ")

9. When the load job is complete, a green check mark appears next to each table. Click **Catalog** in the menu on the left.

    ![Click Catalog in the menu on the left.](./images/click-catalog.png " ")

    > **Note:** If the menu on the left is collapsed, click the double arrows icon to expand it so that the label for each icon is displayed.

    ![Click Expand to expand the menu on the lef.](./images/expand-menu.png " ")

10. The Catalog displays the two newly created tables: *CUSTOMER\_SEGMENT* and *CUSTOMER\_EXTENSION*.

    ![View the new table in the Catalog.](./images/display-new-tables.png " ")

    You can click a table name to display its data. Click the *CUSTOMER\_SEGMENT* table to view the data. When finished, click **Close**, and then click **Done**.

    ![Click customer_segment to display its data.](./images/customer-segment-data.png " ")

This completes the lab on loading .csv files from your local computer to new tables in your ADB instance.

You may now proceed to the next lab.
