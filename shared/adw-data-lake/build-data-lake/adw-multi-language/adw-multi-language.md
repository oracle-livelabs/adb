# ADW Support for Multiple Languages

In this workshop, you will learn about the capabilities of Oracle Autonomous AI Lakehouse to support multiple languages. You will also identify some of the available and related LiveLabs workshops.

## Introduction

Oracle Autonomous AI Lakehouse (LH) is an exceptional polyglot system that offers an array of advanced capabilities, which can be seamlessly extended to process data lakes. With ADW, you can harness the power of SQL, Python, R, Graph, Spatial, JSON, and REST to streamline and optimize your data lake workflows.

Estimated Time: 10 minutes

### Objectives

In this lab, you will learn how to:

* Leverage SQL in Oracle Autonomous AI Lakehouse for data lake processing.
* Apply Python to your data lake workflows.
* Extend R's capabilities to your data lake, enabling more comprehensive data analysis.
* Leverage graph capabilities in your data lake workflows.
* Leverage spatial capabilities in your data lake.
* Use SQL and PL/SQL against JSON data stored in Oracle Database 26ai.
* Use SQL and REST workshop tools, connect to your Oracle Autonomous AI Database, REST enable a table, and secure REST endpoint.

## Task 1: Oracle Autonomous AI Lakehouse SQL Support

ADW's SQL capability allows you to efficiently manipulate and query data within your data lake, extracting valuable insights and performing complex analytics. Whether you're aggregating data, joining tables, or filtering records, ADW's SQL power can be extended to your data lake, enhancing its processing capabilities.

To learn how to leverage SQL in Oracle Autonomous AI Lakehouse for data lake processing, see **Lab 2: Introduction to Oracle Machine Learning for SQL** in the [Oracle Machine Learning Fundamentals on Oracle Autonomous AI Database](https://livelabs.oracle.com/pls/apex/dbpm/r/livelabs/view-workshop?wid=922) LiveLabs workshop.

## Task 2: Oracle Autonomous AI Lakehouse Python Support

Python in Oracle Autonomous AI Lakehouse empowers you to perform advanced data analysis, machine learning, and data manipulation tasks. By utilizing Python's rich ecosystem of libraries and frameworks, you can unlock the full potential of your data lake. Whether it's data cleansing, feature engineering, or model training, Python's flexibility can be extended to your data lake, making it a valuable asset.

To learn how to apply Python to your data lake workflows, see **Lab 3: Introduction to Oracle Machine Learning for Python** in the [Oracle Machine Learning Fundamentals on Oracle Autonomous AI Database](https://livelabs.oracle.com/pls/apex/dbpm/r/livelabs/view-workshop?wid=922) LiveLabs workshop.

## Task 3: Oracle Autonomous AI Lakehouse R Support

R integration in Oracle Autonomous AI Lakehouse provides powerful statistical analysis, data visualization, and advanced analytics capabilities. By leveraging R's comprehensive set of packages, you can unlock deeper insights and uncover hidden patterns within your data lake.

To learn how to extend R's capabilities to your data lake, enabling more comprehensive data analysis, see **Lab 4: Introduction to Oracle Machine Learning for R** in the [Oracle Machine Learning Fundamentals on Oracle Autonomous AI Database](https://livelabs.oracle.com/pls/apex/dbpm/r/livelabs/view-workshop?wid=922) LiveLabs workshop.

## Task 4: Oracle Autonomous AI Lakehouse Graph Support

Oracle Autonomous AI Lakehouse's Graph capability is invaluable for analyzing complex relationships within your data lake. By utilizing graph algorithms and functions, you can uncover intricate connections and patterns, such as social networks or supply chain dependencies. Extend the power of graph analytics from ADW to your data lake to gain deeper insights into your data.

To learn how to leverage graph capabilities in your data lake workflows, see the [Get Started with Graph Studio on Oracle Autonomous AI Database](https://livelabs.oracle.com/pls/apex/dbpm/r/livelabs/view-workshop?wid=758) LiveLabs workshop.

## Task 5: Oracle Autonomous AI Lakehouse Spatial Support

Spatial analysis is made seamless in Oracle Autonomous AI Lakehouse with its Spatial capability. By extending the power of spatial analytics to your data lake, you can analyze location-based data, visualize geospatial patterns, and uncover valuable insights.

To learn how to leverage spatial capabilities in your data lake, see the [How to work with spatial data in Oracle Autonomous AI Database (ADB)](https://livelabs.oracle.com/pls/apex/dbpm/r/livelabs/view-workshop?wid=736) LiveLabs workshop.

## Task 6: Oracle Autonomous AI Lakehouse JSON Support

Oracle Autonomous AI Lakehouse's JSON capability allows you to seamlessly work with structured and semi-structured data formats within your data lake. Whether you're dealing with complex nested JSON structures or simple key-value pairs, Oracle Autonomous AI Lakehouse provides the necessary tools and functions to efficiently parse, query, and transform JSON data. By extending the power of JSON processing from ADW to your data lake, you can unlock the potential of this versatile data format.

To learn more about JSON, see the [JSON in Oracle Database 19c](https://livelabs.oracle.com/pls/apex/dbpm/r/livelabs/view-workshop?wid=638) LiveLabs workshop.

## Task 7: Oracle Autonomous AI Lakehouse REST Support

Oracle Autonomous AI Lakehouse's REST interface enables you to interact programmatically with ADW using HTTP requests. This interface allows for seamless integration with external systems and workflows, providing flexibility and enabling automation. By extending the power of REST from ADW to your data lake, you can leverage the REST interface to access, query, and manage data with ease.

To learn more about REST, see the [Modern Application Development with Oracle REST Data Services](https://livelabs.oracle.com/pls/apex/dbpm/r/livelabs/run-workshop?p210_wid=815) LiveLabs workshop.

You may now proceed to the next lab.
