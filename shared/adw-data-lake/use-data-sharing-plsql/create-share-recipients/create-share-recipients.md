# Create and Authorize the Data Share Recipient

## Introduction

A data share recipient is an entity such as an individual, an institution, or a software system that receives a data share from a data share provider.A recipient can access the data in the share. A recipient can have access to multiple shares. If you remove a recipient, that recipient loses access to all shares it could previously access.

In this lab, as a data share provider, you will create and authorize a new recipient that will access the data share and the `custsales` table in the share. You will then provide the new recipient with the activation link or the JSON config file that is needed to create a credential to access the data share.

Estimated Time: 15 minutes

### Objectives

In this lab, you will:

* Create a new share delta share recipient.
* Grant the recipient access privileges to the data share.
* As the share provider user, generate and share the activation link with your recipient.
* As the recipient, use the activation link to download the `delta_share_profile.json` configuration file.

### Prerequisites

This lab assumes that you have successfully completed all of the preceding labs in the **Contents** menu on the left.

## Task 1: Create a Data Share Recipient

1. As the **`share_provider`** user, create a new data share recipient named **`training_user`**. The `token_lifetime` parameter specifies for how long the generated token will be valid. In this example, we specified **90 days**. Copy and paste the following script into your SQL Worksheet, and then click the **Run Script** icon.

    ```
    <copy>
    BEGIN
        DBMS_SHARE.CREATE_RECIPIENT(
            recipient_name => 'training_user',
            email => 'training_user@oracle.com',
            token_lifetime=>'90 00:00:00');
    END;
    </copy>
    ```

    ![Create recipient.](images/create-recipient.png)

2. Query the available recipients. Copy and paste the following script into your SQL Worksheet, and then click the **Run Statement** icon.

    ```
    <copy>
    SELECT recipient_name, updated
    FROM user_share_recipients;
    </copy>
    ```

    ![Query recipients.](images/query-recipients.png)

## Task 2: Grant the Recipient Access Privileges to the Data Share

1. As the **`share_provider`** user, grant the new `training_user` recipient access to the `demo_share` data share. Copy and paste the following script into your SQL Worksheet, and then click the **Run Script** icon.

    ```
    <copy>
    BEGIN
        DBMS_SHARE.GRANT_TO_RECIPIENT(
            share_name=>'demo_share',
            recipient_name=> 'training_user',
            AUTO_COMMIT=>true);
    END;
    /
    </copy>
    ```

    ![Grant access to share.](images/grant-recipient-access.png)

2. Query the data shares access privileges for the `training_user` recipient. Copy and paste the following script into your SQL Worksheet, and then click the **Run Script** icon.

    ```
    <copy>
    SELECT recipient_name, share_name
    FROM user_share_recipient_grants
    WHERE recipient_name = 'TRAINING_USER';
    </copy>
    ```

    ![Check recipient access privileges.](images/query-privileges.png)

    The `training_user` recipient has access privileges to only one data share, `demo_share`.

## Task 3: Share the Activation Link or the Profile Information with the Recipient

As the **`share_provider`** user, you need to provide the `training_user` recipient with the _activation link_ to download the **`delta_share_profile.json`** configuration file. The recipient will need the `delta_share_profile.json` file to create an access credential in the next lab.

<!---
Expose the following paragraph when method 2 bug is corrected.
As the `share_provider` user, you need to provide the `training_user` recipient with the _activation link_ needed to download the **`delta_share_profile.json`** configuration file. This is described in the **Method 1** section below; alternatively, you can generate the `delta_share_profile.json` file directly as the `share_provider` user, and then share it with the `training_user` recipient. This is described in the 

**Method 2** section below. Use this task when method 2 is fixed. **Method 1: The `share_provider` user provides the recipient with the activation link (used in this workshop)** --->

### **The `share_provider` user provides the recipient with the activation link**

1. As the  **`share_provider`** user, generate the activation link's URL that will enable the authorized recipient to download the `delta_share_profile.json` configuration file. Copy and paste the following script into your SQL Worksheet, and then click the **Run Script** icon.

    ```
    <copy>
    BEGIN
        DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE(
        REPLACE(
        DBMS_SHARE.GET_ACTIVATION_LINK('training_user'),
        '/dwcsseed.',
        '/' || REPLACE(LOWER(SYS_CONTEXT('USERENV','CON_NAME')),'_','-') || '.'));
    END;
    /
     </copy>
    ```

    The activation link is generated.

    ![Generate the activation link URL using method 1.](images/method-1-temp.png)

<!--- July 18: The original activation link generation code. Will revert to this in 3 weeks when the fix makes it to production. --->

<!---
    ```
    <copy>
    BEGIN
        DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE(dbms_share.get_activation_link
            (recipient_name=>'TRAINING_USER'));
    END;
    /
    </copy>
    ```--->

2. Save the result of the script so that you can save a copy of the activation link locally. In the **Script Output** tab, click the **Download script output** icon.

    ![Click the download script output icon.](images/click-download-script-output.png)

    The output of the script is downloaded as a text file to your **Downloads** folder.

    ![The script output is downloaded.](images/script-output-downloaded.png)

3. Open the text file to view its content. Copy the activation link and share it with your authorized `training_user` recipient using email, slack, or any other method. This enables this user to download the **`delta_share_profile.json`** configuration file.

    ![Open the text file and share the activation link with the recipient.](images/share-activation-link.png)

### **The recipient downloads the `delta_share_profile.json` configuration file**

As the `training_user` recipient user, you can use the activation link URL that was provided to you by your `share_provider` user to download the **`delta_share_profile.json`** configuration file. This file (delta profile) contains the required credentials that you need in order to  connect to the data share and access its tables.

>**Note:** For the recipient to download the `.json` file, it doesn't matter what user you are logged in as. All you need is a Web browser.

1. Copy the activation link URL that was provided to you by your share provider and paste it in your web browser's address bar, and then press **[Enter]**. The **Autonomous Database Data Sharing** page is displayed. To download the config file, click **Get Profile Information**.

    ![Click Get Profile Information.](images/click-get-profile.png)

    >**Note:** You can download this profile file only once; therefore, make sure you save it once it's downloaded.

    The **Profile information downloaded** page is displayed and the downloaded file is displayed in a popup window.

    ![Profile file downloaded.](images/screen-2.png)

2. The **`delta_share_profile`.json** file is downloaded to your browser's Downloads directory.

    ![The downloaded file is displayed.](images/downloaded-file.png)

3. Open the downloaded file. The file content is displayed. You will need this information in the next lab to connect and use the data share.

    ![Open the delta share profile file.](images/open-profile.png)

<!--- July 18, 2023: Hiding the method 2 section until this is fixed since David slacked me that there is no fix yet for this step.

**Method 2: The `share_provider` user generates the `delta_share_profile.json` configuration file and shares it with the Recipient**

As a share provider user, you can use this second method to directly generate the `JSON` config file which you can then share with recipient using any method you desire.

1. For this step, you need to log in to your SQL Worksheet as the **`admin`** user. Log out of the **`share_provider`** user. On the **Oracle Database Actions | SQL** banner, click the drop-down list next to the **`SHARE_PROVIDER`** user, and then select **Sign Out** from the drop-down menu. When prompted if you want to leave the site, click **Leave**.

2. Log in as the **`admin`** user. On the **Sign-in** page, enter **`ADMIN`** as the username and **`Training4ADW`** as the password, and then click **Sign in**. You are now logged in as the **`ADMIN`** user. In the **Development** section, click the **SQL** card to display the SQL Worksheet.

    ![Logged in as user admin](images/logged-admin.png)

3. Grant the `http` and `http_proxy` privileges for the specified host to the `DWROLE` role. Use the `DBMS_NETWORK_ACL_ADMIN` package and the `APPEND_HOST_ACE` procedure. For information about the `DBMS_NETWORK_ACL_ADMIN` package, see the [PL/SQL Packages and Types Reference](https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/oracle-database/19/arpls/DBMS_NETWORK_ACL_ADMIN.html#GUID-254AE700-B355-4EBC-84B2-8EE32011E692) documentation. This is explained in more detail in the next lab. Copy and paste the following script into your SQL Worksheet, and then click the **Run Script** icon.

    >**Note:** Substitute the host value below with your own host value which you can copy from your browser's address bar.

    ![Find the host URL.](images/host-url.png)

    In our example, the host value is the following portion of the URL shown in the address bar:

    **`ukgyxp2x0rqadss-trainingadw.adb.ca-toronto-1.oraclecloudapps.com`**

    ```
    <copy>
    BEGIN
    DBMS_NETWORK_ACL_ADMIN.APPEND_HOST_ACE(
        host => 'ukgyxp2x0rqadss-trainingadw.adb.ca-toronto-1.oraclecloudapps.com',
        lower_port => 443,
        upper_port => 443,
        ace => xs$ace_type(
        privilege_list => xs$name_list('http', 'http_proxy'),
        principal_name => upper('DWROLE'),
        principal_type => xs_acl.ptype_db));
    END;
    /
    </copy>
    ```

    ![Set ACLs.](images/set-acls.png)

4. Log out of the **`admin`** user. On the **Oracle Database Actions | SQL** banner, click the drop-down list next to the `ADMIN` user, and then select **Sign Out** from the drop-down menu. When prompted if you want to leave the site, click **Leave**.

5. Log in as the **`share_provider`** user. On the **Sign-in** page, enter **`share_provider`** as the username and **`DataShare4ADW`** as the password, and then click **Sign in**. In the **Development** section, click the **SQL** card to display the SQL Worksheet.

6. Generate the Delta Share `JSON` config file for your `training_user` recipient. Copy and paste the following script into your SQL Worksheet, and then click the **Run Script** icon.

    ```
    <copy>
    DECLARE
    profile SYS.JSON_OBJECT_T;
    BEGIN
        DBMS_SHARE.POPULATE_SHARE_PROFILE('TRAINING_USER', profile);
        SYS.DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE(CHR(10)||JSON_QUERY(profile.to_string, '$' PRETTY));
    END;
    /
    </copy>
    ```

7. The **`delta_share_profile.json`** configuration file information is displayed in the **Script Output** tab.

    ![A sample generated JSON config file.](images/sample-generated-file.png)

8. Save the script output (profile information) to a text editor of your choice on your local machine (using the copy and paste method) so that you can have a record of it. You'll need this file with the recipient.

    ![Save the generated JSON config file locally.](images/save-json-file.png)

9. As the recipient user, you will need all of the values from the previous step in the next lab to create the required credential to access your authorized data share.--->

You may now proceed to the next lab.
