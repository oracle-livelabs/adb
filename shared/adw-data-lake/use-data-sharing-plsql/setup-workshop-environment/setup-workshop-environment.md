# Review the Workshop Environment Setup (Optional)

## Introduction

Since you are using the LiveLabs environment, you **don't** have administrative privileges to create any OCI resources; therefore, all of the OCI resources that you need in this workshop are already created for you with your LiveLabs reservation.

If you want to review the detailed steps on how to set up the workshop environment when you are using either the **freetier** version or your own paid tenancy, see **Lab 1: Set Up the Workshop Environment** in the freetier version of the workshop on LiveLabs titled **Build a Data Lake with Autonomous Warehouse**.

> **Note:** This lab is directed at administrator users because they are granted the required access permissions. In real life scenarios, you would create a new ADW administrator user and a ADW administrator group, and then add the new administrator user to the new group. Next, you create the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies that are required to create and manage an ADW and Data Catalog instances.

Estimated Time: 5 minutes

# Set Up the Workshop Environment

## Introduction

This lab walks you through the steps to set up the workshop environment.

> **Note:** This workshop is directed at administrator users because they are have the required privileges.

Estimated Time: 5 minutes

### Objectives

In this lab, you will:

* Log in to the Oracle Cloud Console.
* (Optional) Create a compartment for your resources.
* Create an Autonomous Warehouse instance.

### Prerequisites

* An Oracle Cloud Account - Please view this workshop's LiveLabs landing page to see which environments are supported.

> **Note:** If you have a **Free Trial** account, when your Free Trial expires your account will be converted to an **Always Free** account. You will not be able to conduct Free Tier workshops unless the Always Free environment is available. [Click here for the Free Tier FAQ page.](https://www.oracle.com/cloud/free/faq.html)

## Task 1: Log in to the Oracle Cloud Console

1. Log in to the **Oracle Cloud Console** as the Cloud Administrator. You will complete all the labs in this workshop using this Cloud Administrator.
See [Signing In to the Console](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/GSG/Tasks/signingin.htm) in the _Oracle Cloud Infrastructure_ documentation.

2. On the **Sign In** page, select your tenancy, enter your username and password, and then click **Sign In**.

   ![The blurred username and masked password are displayed on the OCI Sign in screen. The tenancy's name and username are blurred. The Sign In button is highlighted.](./images/sign-in.png " ")

   The **Oracle Cloud Console** Home page is displayed.

   ![The partial Oracle Cloud Console Home Page is displayed.](./images/oracle-cloud-console-home.png "Partial Oracle Cloud Console is displayed.")

    >**Note:** To zoom in (magnify) a displayed image in this workshop, hover over the image to display the magnifying glass icon, and then then click the image.

   ![An example of magnifying an image. The magnifying glass icon with a plus sign is shown as hoovering over a sample image.](./images/magnify-image.png "Click an image to magnify it.")

## Task 2: (Optional) Create a Compartment

A Cloud Administrator can optionally create a compartment in your tenancy to help organize your resources. In this lab, as a Cloud Administrator, you will create a new compartment that will group all of your resources that you will use in the workshop.

1. Open the **Navigation** menu and click **Identity & Security**. Under **Identity**, click **Compartments**.

       ![The Navigation menu is clicked. The navigation path to Compartments is displayed.](./images/navigate-compartment.png "Click the Navigation menu, and navigate to Compartments.")

    For faster navigation, you can pin items that you use frequently. To pin an item, hover over the menu item and then click pin to the left of the item name.

    ![An example on pinning an item such as Data Lake/Data Catalog for quicker access is shown.](./images/pin-items.png " ")

    The pinned item is displayed in the **Pinned** section of the **Home** tab the next time you use the Navigation menu.

    ![An example that shows the Compartment item pinned.](./images/pinned-item.png " ")

    The **Recently visited** section of the **Home** tab shows recently used navigation items.

    To quickly find navigation menu items, use the **Search** box.

2. On the **Compartments** page, click **Create Compartment**.

   ![The Compartments page is displayed. The Create Compartment button is highlighted.](./images/click-create-compartment.png " ")

3. In the **Create Compartment** dialog box, enter **`training-adw-compartment`** in the **Name** field and **`Training ADW Compartment`** in the **Description** field.

4. In the **Parent Compartment** drop-down list, select your parent compartment, and then click **Create Compartment**.

   ![On the completed Create Compartment dialog box, click Create Compartment.](./images/create-compartment.png " ")

   The **Compartments** page is re-displayed and the newly created compartment is displayed in the list of available compartments.

   ![The newly created compartment is highlighted with its status as Active.](./images/compartment-created.png " ")

## Task 3: Create an Autonomous Data Warehouse Instance

1. Log in to the **Oracle Cloud Console** as the Cloud Administrator, if you are not already logged in. On the **Sign In** page, select your tenancy, enter your username and password, and then click **Sign In**. The **Oracle Cloud Console** Home page is displayed.

2. Open the **Navigation** menu and click **Oracle Database**. Under **Oracle Database**, click **Autonomous Data Warehouse**.

3. On the **Autonomous Databases** page, select your compartment from the **Compartment** drop-down list in the **List Scope** section. In this example, we selected our **`training-adw-compartment`**. Click **Create Autonomous Database**. The **Create Autonomous Database** page is displayed.

4. In the **Provide basic information for the Autonomous Database** section, specify the following:
       * **Compartment:** Select your own compartment.
       * **Display Name:** **`ADW-Data-Lake`**.
       * **Database Name:** **`TrainingADW`**.

       ![The completed "Provide basic information for the Autonomous Database" section is displayed.](./images/adb-basic-info.png " ")
