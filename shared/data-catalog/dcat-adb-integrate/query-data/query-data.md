5. Open the imported notebook. Click the **Workshop - Data Lake Accelerator** notebook link. The notebook is displayed in the Notebook **Editor**.

    ![The notebook and the paragraphs it contains is displayed in the Notebook Editor.](./images/notebook-displayed.png " ")


## Task 3: Set the Interpreter Bindings for the Imported Notebook

An interpreter is a plug-in that allows you to use a specific data processing language backend. To display and visualize data using SQL in a notebook paragraph, that data must be fetched from the database; therefore, you must bind a notebook to an interpreter to fetch data from the database or any data source. A default set of interpreter bindings is available. Paragraphs using the **SQL**  (**`%sql`**) and PL/SQL (**`%script`**) interpreters allow you to invoke Oracle SQL and PL/SQL statements, respectively. The interpreter binding order that is set for a notebook applies to all the paragraphs in that notebook. However, you can override the interpreter binding for SQL and PL/SQL interpreters for any specific paragraph in the notebook.

>**Note:** For the Zeppelin Notebooks in Oracle Machine Learning, you use the sql and pl/sql interpreters within an Oracle Database interpreter group and the md (Markdown) interpreter for plain text formatting syntax so that it can be converted to HTML.

1. Click on the gear icon on the top right of the notebook. The **Settings** panel is displayed. The list of available interpreters is displayed in the **Interpreter binding** section.

    ![The gear icon shown as being clicked (labeled as 1) which displays the Settings panel (labeled as 2) and the list of available Interpreter bindings (labeled 3).](./images/settings-panel.png " ")

2. Select at least one of the interpreters that indicate **%sql (default), %script, %python**. You can move the interpreters to change their order and bring the one you prefer to the top. The first interpreter in the list is the default. Click and drag the **your-database-name_medium %sql (default), %script, %python** interpreter to the top of the list to make it the default. Click **Save** to save your changes. See [About Interpreter Bindings and Notebooks](https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/machine-learning/oml-notebooks/omlug/interpreters-and-notebooks.html).

    ![The medium interpreter is shown as moved to the top of the other available interpreters and highlighted. The Save button is highlighted.](./images/reorder-interpreter.png " ")

    The notebook **Editor** is re-displayed.


## Task 4: Explore Oracle Machine Learning Notebooks (Optional)

In this task, you'll review the UI and some of the basic functionality of OML Notebooks. See [Explore Apache Zeppelin UI](https://zeppelin.apache.org/docs/0.10.0/quickstart/explore_ui.html).

>**Note:** If you are already familiar with OML or Zeppelin Notebooks, you may skip this task.  

Oracle Machine Learning Notebooks is a web-based interface for data analysis, data discovery, and data visualization. A notebook is made up of one or more paragraphs. A paragraph is a notebook component where you can write SQL statements, run PL/SQL scripts, and run Python commands. A paragraph has an **code** (input) section and an **output** (result) section. In the input section, specify the interpreter to run along with the text and/or code. This information is sent to the interpreter to be run. In the output section, the results of the interpreter are displayed.
When you create a new notebook, it opens automatically and it contains a single paragraph using the default **`%sql`** interpreter. You can change the interpreter by explicitly specifying other interpreters such as **`%script`**, **`%python`**, or **`%md`** (Markdown).

### Notebook Toolbar
At the top of the notebook, you can find a toolbar which contains the following components:

1. A Title.
2. Command icons.
3. Configuration, list of keyboard shortcuts, and display options.


    ![The partial image shows the three sections highlighted with callouts (circle with a number in the middle) 1, 2, 3 above each section from left to right.](./images/notebook-toolbar.png " ")

On the far left of the toolbar, you can click the Notebook's title to edit it.

![The notebook title is clicked to enable editing.](./images/edit-notebook-title.png " ")

In the middle of the toolbar, you can use the following command icons:

### Paragraph

Each paragraph contains the following components:
1. **Title**: Click the title to edit it.
2. **Code section**: This is where you enter your source code.
3. **Result section**: This is where you can see the result (output) of the code execution.
4. **Paragraph Commands**: Contains command icons that are described below.

    ![The Customer Contact Information in Warehouse paragraphs is shown as an example. The title on top is labeled with callout 1. The Code section under the title is labeled with callout 2. The Result section (table format) is labeled with callout 3. The Paragraph Commands are labeled with callout 4.](./images/paragraph.png " ")

You can configure and run each paragraph individually. You can move and reposition a paragraph in the notebook. You can also adjust a paragraph's width and you can also display line numbers in a paragraph.

### Paragraph commands
On the top-right corner of each paragraph, you can use the command icons to:

1. **Run this paragraph (Shift+Enter)**: Click this icon to execute the paragraph code.
2. **Show/Hide editor (Ctrl+Alt+E)**: Click this toggle icon to show or hide the Editor.
3. **Show/Hide output (Ctrl+Alt+O)**: Click this toggle icon to show or hide the result section.
4. **Configure the paragraph**: Click this icon to configure the paragraph (described below).

![The Command icons section shows the status READY. Callouts 1 and 3 are shown above icons 1 and 3 from left to right. Callouts 2 and 4 are shown below icons 2 and 4 from left to right.](./images/paragraph-commands.png " ")

The status of each paragraph is displayed next to the command icons. If you already ran the paragraph like in our example, it status is **FINISHED**. If you have not run a paragraph yet, its status is **READY**.

To configure a paragraph, click the gear icon. A drop-down list is displayed.

![The gear icon is shown as clicked to show the available options that are described next.](./images/configure-paragraph.png " ")

You can use this drop-down list to do the following:

+ Find the paragraph id
+ Control the paragraph width from 1 to 12
+ Move the paragraph 1 level up
+ Move the paragraph 1 level down
+ Create a new paragraph
+ Run all paragraphs above this paragraph
+ Run all paragraphs below this paragraph
+ Clone (duplicate) this paragraph
+ Show/Hide the paragraph title
+ Change the paragraph title
+ Show/Hide line numbers in the code section
+ Disable the run icon for this paragraph
+ Clear the result section
+ Delete the paragraph


## Task 5: Review and Run the Imported Notebook

1. Display the code sections of all paragraphs in the notebook. On the notebook toolbar, click the **Show/hide the code** toggle icon.

    ![The Show/hide the code on the notebook toolbar is shown as clicked.](./images/show-code.png " ")

    The code section of each paragraph is displayed. For example, paragraphs 1, 2, and 3 in the notebook use the **`%md`** (Markdown) interpreter while paragraphs 4 and 5 use the **`%sql`** interpreter.

    ![The first five paragraphs in the notebook are shown with a numbered callout next to each one (1 to 5). The interpreter type at the beginning of each paragraph is highlighted.](./images/code-displayed.png " ")

    In this notebook, the **`%md`** (Markdown) paragraphs provide useful information about the paragraphs. The **`%md`** Markdown interpreter generates static html from plain Markdown text. In this lab, you will review the code in each paragraph one at a time, run that paragraph, and review the results as desired.

    >**Note:** To hide the code sections of all paragraphs, click the **Show/hide the code** toggle icon again. Keep the code sections displayed in this lab.

2. Display the result (output) sections of all paragraphs in the notebook. On the notebook toolbar, click the **Show/hide the output** icon to show the output sections of the paragraphs where the output section is not shown by default. By default, the Markdown paragraphs had their output sections displayed; therefore, click the **Show/hide the output** icon again to show the output sections of all paragraphs including the Markdown paragraphs.

    ![The Show/hide the output icon on the notebook toolbar is shown as clicked.](./images/show-output.png " ")

    The output section of each paragraph is displayed.

    ![The code and output sections for the first four paragraphs are shown. The output sections of each paragraph are highlighted and labeled as Output sections. The code section of the Top Sales by City paragraph is highlighted and labeled as Code section.](./images/output-displayed.png " ")

3. Hide the code sections for the first three **`%md`** paragraphs. Click **Hide editor** in each paragraph.

    ![The Hide editor icon of the first paragraph is shown as clicked.](./images/hide-editor.png " ")

    The code sections are hidden. It is a good practice to hide the code section of a **`%md`** paragraph since you are only interested in looking at the formatted output.

    ![The code sections of the first three Markdown paragraphs are hidden.](./images/editor-hidden.png " ")

4. Run the **Top Sales by City** paragraph. Click **Run this paragraph**.

    ![The Run this paragraph icon of the Top Sales by City %sql paragraph is highlighted.](./images/run-top-sales.png " ")

    The status of the paragraph goes from `READY` to `PENDING` to `RUNNING` to `FINISHED`. The output is displayed in the result section of the paragraph using the **Area Chart** graph format. You can change the output display format to **Table**, **Bar Chart**, **Pie Chart**, **Line Chart**, **Scatter Chart** formats. You can also use the **Download Data** command icon to download the output using **CSV** and **TSV** formats. Finally, you can use the **settings** link to change the layout of the displayed output.

    ![The output is displayed in the result section of the paragraph using the **Area Chart** graph format. The output toolbar that enables you to select a different output format is highlighted.](./images/top-sales-output.png " ")

    >**Note:** If the status of one or more paragraphs shows **ERROR**, reset your notebook connection as follows: Click the **Navigation** menu on the Notebook banner, and then select **Notebook Sessions**. On the **Notebook Sessions** page, select your notebook, and then click **Stop**. Next, re-run the notebook.

5. Click **Bar Chart** on the toolbar to change the output display format.

    ![The Bar Chart icon is shown as clicked and the bar chart output is displayed.](./images/top-sales-bar-chart.png " ")

6. Examine, run, and review the output of the remaining paragraphs, as desired. To run the entire notebook, click the **Run all paragraphs** icon on the notebook toolbar. A **Run all** confirmation message box is displayed. Click **OK**.

    ![The code and result sections of all paragraphs are displayed.](./images/run-notebook.png " ")
