# Provision an Oracle Autonomous Database (ADW and ATP)

## Introduction

This lab walks you through the steps to get started using the Oracle Autonomous Database (Autonomous Data Warehouse [ADW] and Autonomous Transaction Processing [ATP]) on Oracle Cloud. In this lab, you will provision a new ADW instance.

>**Note:** While this lab uses ADW, the steps are the same for creating an ATP database.

Estimated Time: 5 minutes

Watch the video below for a quick walk-through of the lab.

### Objectives

In this lab, you will:

-   Learn how to provision a new Autonomous Database

### Prerequisites

- This lab requires completion of the Get Started section in the Contents menu on the left.

## Task 1: Choose ADW or ATP from the services menu

1. Log in to the Oracle Cloud.
2. Once you log in, the cloud services dashboard shows all the services available to you. Click the navigation menu in the upper left to show top level navigation choices.

    > **Note:** You can also directly access your Autonomous Data Warehouse or Autonomous Transaction Processing service in the **Launch resources** section of the dashboard.

    ![Launch Resources](./images/launch-resources.png " ")

3. The following steps apply similarly to either Autonomous Data Warehouse or Autonomous Transaction Processing. This lab shows provisioning of an Autonomous Data Warehouse database, so click **Oracle Database**, then **Autonomous Data Warehouse**.

    ![Click Autonomous Data Warehouse.](https://oracle-livelabs.github.io/common/images/console/database-adw.png " ")

4. Make sure your Workload Type is __Data Warehouse__ or __All__ to see your Autonomous Data Warehouse instances. Use the __List Scope__ drop-down menu to select a compartment. If you are running the workshop using the Green Button (on a sandbox environment), find the compartment assigned to you shown on your *Reservation Information* page and go to that compartment. Enter the first part of your user name, for example `LL185` in the Search Compartments field to quickly locate your compartment.

    <if type="freetier">
    ![Check the workload type on the left.](images/task1-4.png " ")

   > **Note:** Avoid the use of the `ManagedCompartmentforPaaS` compartment, as this is an Oracle default used for Oracle Platform Services.
   </if>

5. This console shows that no databases yet exist. If there were a long list of databases, you could filter the list by the **State** of the databases (Available, Stopped, Terminated). You can also sort by __Workload Type__. In this example, __Data Warehouse__ is the workload type.

    ![Autonomous Databases console.](./images/task1-5.png " ")

<if type="freetier">
6. If you are using a Free Trial or Always Free account, and you want to use Always Free Resources, you need to be in a region where Always Free Resources are available. You can see your current default **region** in the top, right hand corner of the page.

    ![Select region on the far upper-right corner of the page.](./images/task1-6.png " ")
</if>

## Task 2: Create the Oracle Autonomous Database instance

1. Click **Create Autonomous Database** to start the instance creation process.

    ![Click Create Autonomous Database.](./images/task2-1.png " ")

2.  This brings up the __Create Autonomous Database__ screen where you will specify the configuration of the instance.

    <if type="livelabs">
    ![The Create Autonomous Database screen for configuring the instance](./images/task2-2.png " ")
    </if>
    <if type="freetier">
    ![The Create Autonomous Database screen for configuring the instance](./images/task2-2.png " ")
    </if>

3. Specify basic information for the autonomous database:

    - __Compartment__ - Choose the compartment assigned to you.
    - __Display Name__ - Enter a memorable name for the database for display purposes. For example, use __ADW\_Finance\_Mart__.
    - __Database Name__ - Use letters and numbers only, starting with a letter. Maximum length is 14 characters. (Underscores not initially supported.)
    <if type="livelabs">For example, use __ADWFINANCE__ and **append your user id**. For example, if your user id is **LL-185**, then enter __ADWFINANCE185__
    </if><if type="freetier">For example, use __ADWFINANCE__.</if>

    <if type="livelabs">
    ![Enter the required details.](./images/task2-3.png " ")
    </if>
    <if type="freetier">
    ![Enter the required details.](./images/task2-3.png " ")
    </if>


4. Choose a workload type. Select the workload type for your database from the choices:

    - __Data Warehouse__ - For this lab, choose __Data Warehouse__ as the workload type.
    - __Transaction Processing__ - Or, you could have chosen Transaction Processing as the workload type.

    ![Choose a workload type.](./images/task2-4.png " ")

5. Choose a deployment type. Select the deployment type for your database from the choices:

    - __Serverless__ - For this lab, choose __Serverless__ as the deployment type.
    - __Dedicated Infrastructure__ - Or, you could have chosen Dedicated Infrastructure as the deployment type.

    ![Choose a deployment type.](./images/task2-5.png " ")

6. Configure the database:

    Oracle now offers two billing metrics OCPU and ECPU for sizing Autonomous Databases. In addition to the OCPU metric,  ECPU base metric was made available from 31st January 2023 and is going to be default metric.  Existing customer can continue to use OCUP metric and dose not need any changes. Any new database creation request would give OCPU or ECPU based on the user tenancy setup.

    For this workshop we would create a ADW instance with OCPU metric only. To change from ECPU to OCPU metric, click on the __Show advanced Options__ link as show in picture below

    ![Choose show advanced option link to select between OCUP and ECUP metric.](./images/ecpu-metric.png " ")

    Select OCPU option on the pop-up dialog-box that come in right side as shown in picture below

    ![Select OCPU metric option](./images/change-ecpu-to-ocpu.png " ")


    - __Always Free__ - If your Cloud Account is an Always Free account, or your Cloud Account is a paid account but want to avoid any charges, you can select this option to create an *Always Free autonomous database*. An always free database comes with 1 CPU and 20 GB of storage. For this lab, we recommend you leave Always Free unchecked.
    - __Choose database version__ - Select a database version from the available versions.
    - __OCPU count__ - Number of CPUs for your service. For this lab, specify __1 CPU__. If you choose an Always Free database, it comes with 1 CPU.
    - __Storage (TB)__ - Select your storage capacity in terabytes. For this lab, specify __1 TB__ of storage. Or, if you choose an Always Free database, it comes with 20 GB of storage.
    - __OCPU auto scaling__ - For this lab, keep auto scaling enabled, to enable the system to automatically use up to three times more CPU and IO resources to meet workload demand.
    - __Storage auto scaling__ - For this lab, there is no need to enable storage auto scaling, which would allow the system to expand up to three times the reserved storage.

    > **Note:** You cannot scale up/down an Always Free autonomous database.

    ![Choose the remaining parameters.](./images/task2-6.png " ")



7. Create administrator credentials:

    - __Password and Confirm Password__ - Specify the password for ADMIN user of the service instance. The password must meet the following requirements:
    - The password must be between 12 and 30 characters long and must include at least one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, and one numeric character.
    - The password cannot contain the username.
    - The password cannot contain the double quote (") character.
    - The password must be different from the last 4 passwords used.
    - The password must not be the same password that you set less than 24 hours ago.
    - Re-enter the password to confirm it. Make a note of this password.

    ![Enter password and confirm password.](./images/task2-7.png " ")

8. Choose network access:
    - For this lab, accept the default, **Secure access from everywhere**.
    - If you want to allow traffic only from the IP addresses and VCNs you specify - where access to the database from all public IPs or VCNs is blocked, select **Secure access from allowed IPs and VCNs only** in the Choose network access area.
    - If you want to restrict access to a private endpoint within an OCI VCN, select **Private endpoint access only** in the Choose network access area.
    - If the **Require mutual TLS (mTLS) authentication** option is selected, mTLS will be required to authenticate connections to your Autonomous Database. TLS connections allow you to connect to your Autonomous Database without a wallet, if you use a JDBC thin driver with JDK8 or above. See the [documentation for network options](https://docs.oracle.com/en/cloud/paas/autonomous-database/adbsa/support-tls-mtls-authentication.html#GUID-3F3F1FA4-DD7D-4211-A1D3-A74ED35C0AF5) for options to allow TLS, or to require only mutual TLS (mTLS) authentication.

10. For this lab, do not provide a contact email address. The **Contact Email** field allows you to list contacts to receive operational notices and announcements as well as unplanned maintenance notifications.

    ![Do not provide a contact email address.](images/contact-email-field.png)


11. Click __Create Autonomous Database__. If you see an error *Authorization failed or requested resource not found*, it means you are not in the compartment assigned to you. To solve this error, refer to Task 1 -> Step 4 to choose the correct compartment assigned to you, as shown on your *Reservation Information* page.

    ![Click Create Autonomous Database.](./images/task2-10.png " ")

12.  Your instance will begin provisioning. In a few minutes, the state will turn from Provisioning to Available. At this point, your Autonomous Data Warehouse database is ready to use! Have a look at your instance's details here including its name, database version, OCPU count, and storage size.

    ![Database instance homepage.](./images/task2-11.png " ")

You may now **proceed to the next lab**.
