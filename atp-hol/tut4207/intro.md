# Introduction

This lab walks you through the steps to quickly provision an Autonomous Transaction Processing instance on Oracle Cloud. In this lab we will create web application which will take medical documents and store them in the Autonomous Database. Further we will also use Oracle Text to allow users to filter, search, and view those documents with one-click.

Estimated time: 90 minutes

### Objectives

- Create a new APEX workspace 
- Build a web application
- Explore and implement Oracle Text 


## Oracle APEX

Oracle APEX is a low-code development platform that enables you to build scalable, secure enterprise apps, with world-class features, that can be deployed anywhere.

Using APEX, developers can quickly develop and deploy compelling apps that solve real problems and provide immediate value. You won't need to be an expert in a vast array of technologies to deliver sophisticated solutions. Focus on solving the problem and let APEX take care of the rest.
